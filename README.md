# Reach

We are building the next generation blockchain development platform
that will completely transform the paradigm of decentralized
application (DApp) development. DApps have enormous potential, but are
impractical today because of barriers that have kept blockchain
development risky and limited to specialists, like cryptographers. The
Reach platform is a comprehensive environment that enables junior
developers to build useful and safe DApps without years of experience
and easily deploy them on a variety of different blockchain networks.

This repository is for the Reach language, the domain-specific
language for trustworthy DApps used by the Reach platform.
