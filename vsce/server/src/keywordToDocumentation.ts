  "Either": "\n`Either` is defined by\n```javascript\nexport const Either = (A, B) => Data({Left: A, Right: B});\n```\n\n`Either` can be used to represent values with two possible types.\n\nSimilar to `Maybe`, `Either` may be used to represent values that are correct or erroneous.\nA successful result is stored, by convention, in `Right`. Unlike `None`, `Left` may\ncarry additional information about the error.\n\n\n```javascript\neither(e, onLeft, onRight)\n```\n\n `either(e, onLeft, onRight)` will either apply the function `onLeft` or `onRight` depending on `e`.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst e = Either(UInt, Bool);\nconst l = e.Left(1);\nconst r = e.Right(true);\nisLeft(l);  // true\nisRight(l); // false\nconst x = fromLeft(l, 0);      // x = 1\nconst y = fromRight(l, false); // y = false\n```\n\n `isLeft` is a convenience method that determines whether the variant is `Left`.\n\n `isRight` is a convenience method that determines whether the variant is `Right`.\n\n `fromLeft(e, default)` is a convenience method that returns the value in `Left`,\nor `default` if the variant is `Right`.\n\n `fromRight(e, default)` is a convenience method that returns the value in `Right`,\nor `default` if the variant is `Left`.\n\nThis snippet demonstrates the convenience methods:\n\n```javascript\n      const e = Either(UInt, Bool);\n      A.only(() => {\n        const l = e.Left(5);\n        const r = e.Right(false);\n        either(l, interact.showInt, interact.showBool);\n        either(r, interact.showInt, interact.showBool);\n        assert(isLeft(l));\n        assert(!isLeft(r));\n        assert(isRight(r));\n        assert(!isRight(l));\n        assert(fromLeft(l, 0) == 5);\n        assert(fromLeft(r, 0) == 0);\n        assert(fromRight(r, true) == false);\n        assert(fromRight(l, true));\n      });\n```\n",

  "FixedPoint": "\n```javascript\nexport const FixedPoint = Object({ sign: bool, i: Object({ scale: UInt, i: UInt }) });\n```\n\n`FixedPoint` can be used to represent numbers with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point.\nThey are handy for representing fractional values, especially in base 10. The value of a fixed point number is determined\nby dividing the underlying integer value, `i`, by its scale factor, `scale`. For example, we could\nrepresent the value `1.234` with `{ sign: Pos, i: { scale: 1000, i : 1234 } }` or `fx(1000)(Pos, 1234)`.\nAlternatively, Reach provides syntactic sugar for defining `FixedPoint` numbers. One can simply write\n`1.234`, which will assume the value is in base 10. A scale factor of `1000` correlates to 3 decimal\nplaces of precision. Similarly, a scale factor of `100` would have 2 decimal places of precision.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst scale = 10;\nconst i = 56;\nfx(scale)(Neg, i); // represents - 5.6\n```\n\n `fx(scale)(i)` will return a function that can be used to\ninstantiate fixed point numbers with a particular scale factor.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst i = 4;\nfxint(-i); // represents - 4.0\n```\n\n `fxint(Int)` will cast the `Int` arg as a `FixedPoint`\nnumber with a `scale` of 1.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst x = fx(1000)(Pos, 1234); // x = 1.234\nfxrescale(x, 100);    // => 1.23\n```\n\n `fxrescale(x, scale)` will convert a fixed point number from using\none scale to another. This operation can result in loss of precision, as demonstrated in the above example.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst x = fx(1000)(Pos, 824345); // x = 824.345\nconst y = 45.67;\nfxunify(x, y);    // => [ 1000, 824.345, 45.670 ]\n```\n\n `fxunify(x, y)` will convert the fixed point numbers\nto use the same scale. The larger scale of the two arguments will be chosen. The function will return a `3-tuple` consisting\nof the common scale and the newly scaled values.\n\n\n `fxadd(x, y)` adds two fixed point numbers.\n\n\n `fxsub(x, y)` subtracts two fixed point numbers.\n\n\n `fxmul(x, y)` multiplies two fixed point numbers.\n\n\n```javascript\nfxdiv(34.56, 1.234, 10)     // => 28\nfxdiv(34.56, 1.234, 100000) // => 28.0064\n```\n\n `fxdiv(x, y, scale_factor)` divides two fixed point numbers. The numerator, `x`,\nwill be multiplied by the scale factor to provide a more precise answer. For example,\n\n\n `fxmod(x, y)` finds the remainder of dividing `x` by `y`.\n\n\n `fxfloor(x)` returns the greatest integer not greater than `x`.\n\n\n `fxsqrt(x, k)` returns the square root of the fixed number, `x`.\n\n\n `fxsqrtApprox(x, k)` approximates the square root of the fixed number, `x`, using `k` iterations of the `sqrtApprox` algorithm.\n\n\n`const base  = 2.0;\nconst power = 0.33;\nfxpow(base, power, 10, 1000);    // 1.260\nfxpow(base, power, 10, 10000);   // 1.2599\nfxpow(base, power, 10, 1000000); // 1.259921 `\n\n `fxpow(base, power, precision, scalePrecision)` approximates the power of the fixed number, `base`,\nraised to the fixed point number, `power`. The third argument must be a `UInt` whose value is known\nat compile time, which represents the number of iterations the algorithm should perform.\nThe `scalePrecision` argument must be a `UInt` and represents the scale of the return value. Choosing a larger\n`scalePrecision` allows for more precision when approximating the power, as demonstrated in the example below:\n\n\n `fxpowi(base, power, precision)` approximates the power of the fixed number, `base`,\nraised to the `Int`, `power`. The third argument must be a `UInt` whose value is known\nat compile time, which represents the number of iterations the algorithm should perform. For reference, `6` iterations\nprovides enough accuracy to calculate up to `2^64 - 1`, so the largest power it can compute is `63`.\n\n\n`fxpowui(5.8, 3, 10); // 195.112 `\n\n `fxpowui(base, power, precision)` approximates the power of\nthe fixed number, `base`, raised to the `UInt`, `power`. The third\nargument must be a `UInt` whose value is known at compile time.\n\n\n `fxcmp(op, x, y)` applies the comparison\noperator to the two fixed point numbers after unifying their scales.\n\nThere are convenience methods defined for comparing fixed point numbers:\n\n\n `fxlt(x, y)` tests whether `x` is less than `y`.\n\n\n `fxle(x, y)` tests whether `x` is less than or equal to `y`.\n\n\n `fxgt(x, y)` tests whether `x` is greater than `y`.\n\n\n `fxge(x, y)` tests whether `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\n\n `fxeq(x, y)` tests whether `x` is equal to `y`.\n\n\n `fxne(x, y)` tests whether `x` is not equal to `y`.\n",

  "mixin": "\n```javascript\nconst makeMixed = mixin({ Base: ..., IDs: ..., View: ..., Events: ..., API: ... });\n\nconst mixedCtc = makeMixed();\n// or, to override `Base` in the definition with above with otherMakeMixed:\nconst mixedCtc = makeMixed(otherMakeMixed);\n\n// mixed fields\nmixedCtc.IDs\nmixedCtc.View\nmixedCtc.Events\nmixedCtc.API\n```\n\n`mixin` is an implementation of mixins (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin) or the [Racket Documentation](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/classes.html#%28part._.Mixins%29) for an explanation of mixins) for composing contract interfaces.\n(These mixins are _only_ for the interface, not the implementation.)\n\nThe function takes an object that optionally contains the fields `IDs`, `View`, `Events`, and `API`.\nThis object represents the interface of a contract, where `IDs` is a `Tuple` of constants, `View` is a `Tuple` of arguments to `View`, `Events` is a `Tuple` of arguments to `Events`, and `API` is a `Tuple` of arguments to `API`.\nThe object optionally also contains a `Base` field, which will be used as a default base interface when constructing the combined contract interface.\n\n`mixin` returns a function, which, when called, combines all of the base interfaces and constructs the final `API`, `View`, and `Events` (using the `API`, `View`, and `Events` constructors respectively).\nThe returned function also takes an optional `Base` parameter, which will be used instead of the base interface found in the `Base` field passed to `mixin`.\n(It is useful to modify the `Base` to implement a specific order of instantiation to implement multiple inheritance.)\n\nAfter composition, the individual components can be access normally.\nFor example, `mixin(....)().View.v.set(vv)` would set the `v` `View` regardless of where the interface was defined.\nThe `IDs` component is intended to hold byte strings that represent ERC-165 interface identifiers.\n\n---\n\nFor example, we define all of the interfaces that are part of the [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) NFT specification using `mixin`:\n```javascript\nconst ERC165 = mixin({\n  IDs: [ Bytes.fromHex('0x01ffc9a7'), ],\n  View: [{\n    supportsInterface: Fun([Bytes(4)], Bool),\n  }],\n});\n\nconst ERC721 = mixin({\n  Base: ERC165,\n  IDs: [ Bytes.fromHex('0x80ac58cd'), ],\n  View: [{\n    balanceOf: Fun([Address], UInt),\n    ownerOf: Fun([UInt], Address),\n    getApproved: Fun([UInt], Address),\n    isApprovedForAll: Fun([Address, Address], Bool),\n  }],\n  Events: [{\n    Transfer: [Address, Address, UInt],\n    Approval: [Address, Address, UInt],\n    ApprovalForAll: [Address, Address, Bool],\n  }],\n  API: [{\n    safeTransferFrom1: Fun([Address, Address, UInt, BytesDyn], Null),\n    safeTransferFrom2: Fun([Address, Address, UInt], Null),\n    transferFrom: Fun([Address, Address, UInt], Null),\n    approve: Fun([Address, UInt], Null),\n    setApprovalForAll: Fun([Address, Bool], Null),\n  }, {\n    safeTransferFrom1: 'safeTransferFrom',\n    safeTransferFrom2: 'safeTransferFrom',\n  }],\n});\n\nconst ERC721Metadata = mixin({\n  Base: ERC721,\n  IDs: [ Bytes.fromHex('0x5b5e139f'), ],\n  View: [{\n    name: StringDyn,\n    symbol: StringDyn,\n    tokenURI: Fun([UInt], StringDyn),\n  }],\n});\n\nconst ERC721Enumerable = mixin({\n  Base: ERC721,\n

construct the final mixed contract, and overriding `ERC721EnumerablePartial`'s base with `ERC721Metadata` (because we want _both_ extensions to ERC-721):\n```javascript\nconst ERC165 = mixin({\n  IDs:
