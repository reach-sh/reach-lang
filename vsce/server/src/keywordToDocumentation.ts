  "FixedPoint": "\n```javascript\nexport const FixedPoint = Object({ sign: bool, i: Object({ scale: UInt, i: UInt }) });\n```\n\n`FixedPoint` can be used to represent numbers with a fixed number of digits after the decimal point.\nThey are handy for representing fractional values, especially in base 10. The value of a fixed point number is determined\nby dividing the underlying integer value, `i`, by its scale factor, `scale`. For example, we could\nrepresent the value `1.234` with `{ sign: Pos, i: { scale: 1000, i : 1234 } }` or `fx(1000)(Pos, 1234)`.\nAlternatively, Reach provides syntactic sugar for defining `FixedPoint` numbers. One can simply write\n`1.234`, which will assume the value is in base 10. A scale factor of `1000` correlates to 3 decimal\nplaces of precision. Similarly, a scale factor of `100` would have 2 decimal places of precision.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst scale = 10;\nconst i = 56;\nfx(scale)(Neg, i); // represents - 5.6\n```\n\n `fx(scale)(i)` will return a function that can be used to\ninstantiate fixed point numbers with a particular scale factor.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst i = 4;\nfxint(-i); // represents - 4.0\n```\n\n `fxint(Int)` will cast the `Int` arg as a `FixedPoint`\nnumber with a `scale` of 1.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst x = fx(1000)(Pos, 1234); // x = 1.234\nfxrescale(x, 100);    // => 1.23\n```\n\n `fxrescale(x, scale)` will convert a fixed point number from using\none scale to another. This operation can result in loss of precision, as demonstrated in the above example.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst x = fx(1000)(Pos, 824345); // x = 824.345\nconst y = 45.67;\nfxunify(x, y);    // => [ 1000, 824.345, 45.670 ]\n```\n\n `fxunify(x, y)` will convert the fixed point numbers\nto use the same scale. The larger scale of the two arguments will be chosen. The function will return a `3-tuple` consisting\nof the common scale and the newly scaled values.\n\n\n `fxadd(x, y)` adds two fixed point numbers.\n\n\n `fxsub(x, y)` subtracts two fixed point numbers.\n\n\n `fxmul(x, y)` multiplies two fixed point numbers.\n\n\n```javascript\nfxdiv(34.56, 1.234, 10)     // => 28\nfxdiv(34.56, 1.234, 100000) // => 28.0064\n```\n\n `fxdiv(x, y, scale_factor)` divides two fixed point numbers. The numerator, `x`,\nwill be multiplied by the scale factor to provide a more precise answer.

It accepts a `DELAY_EXPR` and an `EXPR`, which will be thrown if a timeout should occur.\nIf an `EXPR` is not provided, then `null` will be thrown.\nIf a consensus transfer uses `.throwTimeout`, it must be within a try statement.\n\nIf a consensus transfer specifies a single participant, which has not yet been fixed in the application and is not a participant class, then this statement does so; therefore, after it the `PART` may be used as an address.\n\nIf a consensus transfer specificies a single participant class, then all members of that class will attempt to perform the transfer, but only one will succeed.\n\nA consensus transfer binds the identifiers `ID_0` through `ID_n` for all participants to the values included in the consensus transfer, overwriting any bindings that already exist for those identifiers.\nIf an existing participant, not included in `PART_EXPR`, has previously bound one of these identifiers, then the program is not valid. In other words, the following program is not valid:\n\n```javascript\nAlice.only(() => {\n const x = 1; });\nBob.only(() => {\n const x = 2; });\nClaire.only(() => {\n const x = 3; });\nrace(Alice, Bob).publish(x);\ncommit();\n```\n\nbecause `Claire` is not included in the `race`.\nHowever, if we were to rename `Claire`'s `x` into `y`, then it would be valid, because although `Alice` and `Bob` both bind `x`, they participate in the `race`, so it is allowed.\nIn the tail of this program, `x` is bound to either `1` or `2`, i.e., either `Alice` or `Bob`'s value is overwritten.\nThis overwriting applies even if `Alice` wins and `Alice` is a participant class, i.e., the value of `x` in the tail is guaranteed to be the single value that was agreed upon in the consensus.\n"
