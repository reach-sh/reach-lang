<p>Many decentralized applications have the same structure, similar to how there are many games that can be categorized as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory">combinatorial games</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_game">simultaneous games</a>.</p>
<p>
  These applications can either be programmed individually, or you can build an abstraction that captures the common structure of a game.
  Reach supports typical programming language abstractions, like first-class functions (via arrow expressions) and objects, that can be used to build these abstractions.
</p>
<p>
  When building such abstractions, the most difficult part is correctly capturing <a href="/xxx/guide/loop-invs/#guide-loop-invs">loop invariants</a> of the user of the abstraction on the inside of the abstraction.
  Often, this means the abstraction must set up a protocol to communicate with its user, such as by receiving an invariant captured by an arrow expression.
