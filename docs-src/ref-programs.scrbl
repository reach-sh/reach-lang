@title[#:version reach-vers #:tag "ref-programs" #:style 'toc]{Programs}

This document describes the structure and content of Reach @deftech{programs}, including
their syntactic forms,
the standard library,
and the standards of @tech{valid} programs.

The rest of this section is structured according to the contexts of the different parts of a Reach program, as follows:

@itemlist[

@item{@Secref["ref-programs-valid"] describes what is meant by the term @tech{valid} in Reach.}

@item{@Secref["ref-programs-module"] describes the top-level structure of Reach @tech{module}.}

@item{@Secref["ref-programs-step"] describes the structure of Reach @tech{steps}.}

@item{@Secref["ref-programs-local"] describes the structure of Reach @tech{local steps}.}

@item{@Secref["ref-programs-consensus"] describes the structure of Reach @tech{consensus steps}.}

@item{@Secref["ref-programs-compute"] describes the common structure of Reach computations shared by all contexts.}

@section[#:tag "ref-programs-valid"]{Validity}

Reach imposes further restrictions on syntactically well-formed programs.
These restrictions are described throughout this manual using the term @deftech{valid} to refer to constructions that obey the restrictions,
and the term @deftech{invalid} to refer to constructions that do not obey them.

It is always @tech{invalid} to use a @tech{value} with an operation for which it is undefined.
For example, @reachin{1 + true} is @tech{invalid}.
In other words, Reach enforces a static type discipline.

@subsection{Security levels and scope}

The text of Reach program is @tech{public} knowledge to all @tech{participants}.
However, any value that comes from an @tech{interaction expression} is a @deftech{secret} which only that participant knows.
Furthermore, any values derived from @tech{secret} values are also @tech{secret}.
A value, X, is considered derived from another, Y, if the value of Y is provided to a primitive operation to arrive at X, or if Y is used as part of a conditional that influences the definition of X.
@tech{Secrets} can only be made @tech{public} by using the @tech{declassify} primitive.

When @tech{secret} values are bound to an @tech{identifier}
within a @tech{local step},
the identifier name MUST be prefixed by an underscore (@reachin{_}).

When @tech{public} values are bound to an @tech{identifier},
regardless of context,
the identifier name MUST NOT be prefixed by an underscore (@reachin{_}).

Consequently, identifiers which appear inside of a
@tech{function definition} or @tech{arrow expression}
MAY be prefixed by an underscore.
This will cause a compiler error if any value bound to that
identifier is public.

@section[#:tag "ref-programs-module"]{Modules}

A Reach @deftech{source file} is a textual file which specifies a Reach @tech{module}.
It is traditionally given the file extension @litchar{rsh},
e.g. @filepath{dao.rsh}.

A @deftech{module} starts with @reachin{'reach @|reach-short-vers|';}
followed by a sequence of @tech{imports} and @tech{identifier definitions}.
A module can only be compiled or used if it contain one or more @tech{exports}.
@margin-note{See @seclink["guide-versions"]{the guide section on versions} to understand how Reach uses version numbers like this.}

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-module-stmts"]{Statements}

Any statements valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-stmts"]{computation} are valid for a module.
However, some additional statements are allowed.

@subsubsection[#:tag "ref-programs-export"]{@tt{export}}

Module-level @tech{identifier definitions} may be @deftech{export}ed
by writing @(mint-define! '("export")) @reachin{export} in front of them.
For example,
@reach{
  export const x = 1;
  export const [a, b, ...more] = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
  export function add1(x) { return x + 1; };
}
are valid @tech{exports}.

Module-level identifiers may also be @tech{export}ed after the fact,
and may be renamed during export. For example:

@reach{
 const w = 2;
 const z = 0;
 export {w, z as zero};
}

Identifiers from other modules may be re-exported (and renamed),
even if they are not imported in the current module.
For example:

@reach{
 export {u, x as other_x} from './other-module.rsh';
}

An @tech{export}ed identifier in a given @tech{module} may be @tech{import}ed by other @tech{modules}.

@subsubsection[#:tag "ref-programs-import"]{@tt{import}}

@(mint-define! '("import"))
@reach{import 'games-of-chance.rsh';}

When a @tech{module}, @litchar{X}, contains an @deftech{import},
written @reachin{import "LIB.rsh";},
then the path @filepath{LIB.rsh} must resolve to another Reach @tech{source file}.
The @tech{exports} from the @tech{module} defined by @filepath{LIB.rsh} are included in the set of @tech{bound identifier}s in @litchar{X}.

@(mint-define! '("from"))
@reach{import {flipCoin, rollDice as d6} from 'games-of-chance.rsh';}

Import statements may limit or rename the imported @tech{identifiers}.

@reach{import * as gamesOfChance from 'games-of-chance.rsh';}

Imports may instead bind the entire @tech{module} to a single @tech{identifier},
which is an @tech{object} with @tech{fields} corresponding to that @tech{module}'s @tech{exports}.

@tech{Import} cycles are @tech{invalid}.

The path given to an @tech{import} may @bold{not} include @litchar{..} to specify files outside the current directory @bold{nor} may it be an absolute path.

It @bold{must} be a relative path, which is resolved relative to the parent directory of the @tech{source file} in which they appear.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-module-exprs"]{Expressions}

Any expressions valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-exprs"]{computation} are valid for a module.
However, some additional expressions are allowed.

@subsubsection[#:tag "ref-programs-reach.app"]{@tt{Reach.App}}

@(mint-define! '("Reach") '("App"))
@reach{
export const main =
  Reach.App({}, [["A", {displayResult: Fun(Int, Null)}]], (A) => {
    const result = 0;
    A.only(() => { interact.displayResult(result); })
    return result;
  });
}

@deftech{Reach.App} is a function which accepts three arguments:
@reachin{options},
@reachin{participantDefinitions},
and @reachin{program}.

The @reachin{options} must be an object.
It supports the following options:

@tabular[
#:style 'boxed
(list

(list
 @(begin @(mint-define! '("deployMode")) @reachin{deployMode})
 @~
 @para{@reachin{'constructor'} (default) or @reachin{'firstMsg'}}
 @~
 @para{Determines whether @tech{contract} should be @tech{deploy}ed independently (@reachin{'constructor'}) or as part of the first @tech{publication} (@reachin{'firstMsg'}).
 If deployed as part of the first publication, then the first publication must precede all uses of @reachin{wait} and @reachin{.timeout}.
 See @seclink["guide-deploymode"]{the guide on deployment modes} for a discussion of why to choose a particular mode.}
 )

(list @~ @~ @~ @~ @~)

(list
 @(begin @(mint-define! '("verifyOverflow")) @reachin{verifyOverflow})
 @~
 @para{@reachin{true} or @reachin{false} (default)}
 @~
 @para{Determines whether arithmetic operations automatically introduce static assertions that they do not overflow beyond @reachin{UInt.max}.
 This defaults to @reachin{false}, because it is onerous to verify.
 We recommend turning it on before final deployment, but leaving it off during development.
 When it is @reachin{false}, @tech{connectors} will ensure that overflows do not actually occur on the network.}
 )

(list @~ @~ @~ @~ @~)

(list
 @(begin @(mint-define! '("verifyPerConnector")) @reachin{verifyPerConnector})
 @~
 @para{@reachin{true} or @reachin{false} (default)}
 @~
 @para{Determines whether verification is done per connector, or once for a generic connector.
 When this is @reachin{true}, then connector-specific constants, like @reachin{UInt.max}, will be instantiated to literal numbers.
 This concretization of these constants can induce performance degradation in the verifier.}
 )

(list @~ @~ @~ @~ @~)

(list
 @(begin @(mint-define! '("connectors")) @reachin{connectors})
 @~
 @para{@(mint-define! '("ETH") '("ALGO")) @reachin{[ETH, ALGO]} (default)}
 @~
 @para{A tuple of the @tech{connectors} that the application should be compiled for.
 By default, all available @tech{connectors} are chosen.}
 )

)]

The @reachin{participantDefinitions} argument is an tuple of tuples.
Each tuple is a pair of
@reachin{participantName}
and @reachin{participantInteractInterface}.
@reachin{participantName} is a string which indicates the name of the participant function in the generated @tech{backend} code. Each @reachin{participantName} must be unique.
@reachin{participantInteractInterface} is a @deftech{participant interact interface}, an object where each field indicates the type of a function or value which must be provided to the @tech{backend} by the @tech{frontend} for @tech{interact}ing with the participant.

The @reachin{program} argument must be a syntactic @tech{arrow expression}.
The arguments to this arrow must match the number and order of @reachin{participantDefinitions}.
The function body is the program to be @tech{compile}d.
It specifies a @tech{step}, which means its content is specified by @Secref["ref-programs-step"].
When it returns, it must be in a @tech{step}, as well; which means that its content cannot end within a @tech{consensus step}.

If the result of @reachin{Reach.App} is eventually bound to an identifier that is @tech{export}ed, then it may be a target given to the compiler, as discussed in @seclink["ref-usage-compile"]{the section on usage}.

@section[#:tag "ref-programs-step"]{Steps}

A Reach @tech{step} occurs in the body of @reachin{Reach.App} or in the @tech{continuation} of a @tech{commit statement}.
It represents the actions taken by each of the participants in an application.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-step-stmts"]{Statements}

Any statements valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-stmts"]{computation} are valid for a step.
However, some additional statements are allowed.

@subsubsection{@tt{only} and @tt{each}}

@(mint-define! '("only"))
@reach{
 Alice.only(() => {
   const pretzel = interact.random(); }); }

A @tech{local step} statement is written @reachin{PART.only(() => BLOCK)}, where @reachin{PART} is a @tech{participant} identifier and @reachin{BLOCK} is a @tech{block}.
Within @reachin{BLOCK}, @reachin{PART} is bound to the @tech{address} of the participant.
Any bindings defined within the @tech{block} of a @tech{local step} are available in the @tech{statement}'s @tech{tail} as new @tech{local state}.
For example,

@reach{
 Alice.only(() => {
   const x = 3; });
 Alice.only(() => {
   const y = x + 1; }); }

is a @tech{valid} program where @reachin{Alice}'s @tech{local state} includes the @tech{private} values @reachin{x} (bound to @reachin{3}) and @reachin{y} (bound to @reachin{4}). However, such bindings are @emph{not} @tech{consensus state}, so they are purely @tech{local state}. For example,

@reach{
 Alice.only(() => {
   const x = 3; });
 Bob.only(() => {
   const y = x + 1; }); }

is an @tech{invalid} program, because @reachin{Bob} does not know @reachin{x}.

@(hrule)

@(mint-define! '("each"))
@reach{
 each([Alice, Bob], () => {
   const pretzel = interact.random(); }); }

An @deftech{each} @tech{local step} statement can be written as @reachin{each(PART_TUPLE () => BLOCK)}, where @reachin{PART_TUPLE} is a tuple of @tech{participants} and @reachin{BLOCK} is a @tech{block}.
It is an abbreviation of many @tech{local step} statements that could have been written with @reachin{only}.

@subsubsection{@tt{publish}, @tt{pay}, and @tt{timeout}}

@(mint-define! '("publish") '("pay") '("timeout"))
@reach{
 Alice.publish(wagerAmount)
      .pay(wagerAmount)
      .timeout(DELAY, () => {
        Bob.publish();
        commit();
        return false; }); }
@reach{
 Alice.publish(wagerAmount)
      .pay(wagerAmount)
      .timeout(DELAY, () => closeTo(Bob, false)); }

A @tech{consensus transfer} is written @reachin{PART.publish(ID_0, ..., ID_n).pay(PAY_EXPR).timeout(DELAY_EXPR, () => TIMEOUT_BLOCK)}, where @reachin{PART} is a @tech{participant} identifier, @reachin{ID_0} through @reachin{ID_n} are identifiers for @reachin{PART}'s @tech{public} @tech{local state}, @reachin{PAY_EXPR} is a @tech{public} @tech{expression} evaluating to an amount of @tech{network tokens}, @reachin{DELAY_EXPR} is a @tech{public} @tech{expression} that depends on only @tech{consensus state} and evaluates to a @tech{time delta} represented by a natural number, @reachin{TIMEOUT_BLOCK} is a @tech{timeout} @tech{block}, which will be executed after @reachin{DELAY_EXPR} units of @tech{time} have passed from the end of the last @tech{consensus step} without @reachin{PART} executing this @tech{consensus transfer}.
The @tech{continuation} of a @tech{consensus transfer} @tech{statement} is a @tech{consensus step}, which is finalized with a @tech{commit statement}.
The @tech{continuation} of a timeout block is the same as the continuation of the function the timeout occurs within.

@margin-note{See @seclink["guide-timeout"]{the guide section on non-participation} to understand when to use timeouts and how to use them most effectively.}

The @reachin{publish} component exclusive-or the @reachin{pay} component may be omitted, if either there is no @tech{publication} or no @tech{transfer} of @tech{network tokens} to accompany this @tech{consensus transfer}.
The @reachin{timeout} component may always be omitted.
Each component may occur in any order.
For example, the following are all @tech{valid}:

@reach{
 Alice.publish(coinFlip);

 Alice.pay(penaltyAmount);

 Alice.pay(penaltyAmount).publish(coinFlip);

 Alice.publish(coinFlip)
      .timeout(DELAY, () => closeTo(Bob, () => exit()));

 Alice.pay(penaltyAmount)
      .timeout(DELAY, () => {
        Bob.publish();
        commit();
        exit(); }); }

If the named participant has not yet @tech{join}ed the application, then this statement has the effect of them @tech{join}ing, after which @reachin{PART} may be used as an @tech{address}.

@subsubsection{@tt{wait}}

@(mint-define! '("wait"))
@reach{
 wait(AMT); }

A @deftech{wait statement}, written @reachin{wait(AMOUNT);}, delays the computation until @reachin{AMOUNT} @tech{time delta} units have passed.
It may only occur in a @tech{step}.

@subsubsection{@tt{exit}}

@(mint-define! '("exit"))
@reach{
 exit(); }

An @deftech{exit statement}, written @reachin{exit();}, halts the computation.
It is a @tech{terminator statement}, so it must have an empty @tech{tail}.
It may only occur in a @tech{step}.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-step-exprs"]{Expressions}

Any expressions valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-exprs"]{computation} are valid for a step.
However, some additional expressions are allowed.

@subsubsection{@tt{unknowable}}

@(mint-define! '("unknowable"))
@reach{
 unknowable( Notter, Knower(expr_0, ..., expr_N), [msg] ) }

@index{unknowable} A @tech{knowledge assertion} that the @tech{participant} @reachin{Notter} @emph{does not} know the results of the evaluations of expressions @reachin{expr_0} through @reachin{expr_N}, but that the @tech{participant} @reachin{Knower} @emph{does} know those values.
It accepts an optional bytes argument, which is included in any reported violation.

@subsubsection{@tt{closeTo}}

@(mint-define! '("closeTo"))
@reach{
 closeTo( Who, after ) }

@index{closeTo} Has @tech{participant} @reachin{Who} make a @tech{publication}, then @tech{transfer} the @reachin{balance()} to @reachin{Who} and end the @|DApp| after executing the function @reachin{after} in a @tech{step}.

@section[#:tag "ref-programs-local"]{Local Steps}

A Reach @tech{local step} occurs in the body of @reachin{only} or @reachin{each} statements.
It represents the actions taken by a single participant in an application.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-local-stmts"]{Statements}

Any statements valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-stmts"]{computation} are valid for a local step.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-local-exprs"]{Expressions}

Any expressions valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-exprs"]{computation} are valid for a local step.
However, some additional expressions are allowed.

@subsubsection{@tt{interact}}

@(mint-define! '("interact"))
@reach{
 interact.amount
 interact.notify(handA, handB)
 interact.chooseAmount(heap1, heap2) }

An @deftech{interaction expression}, written @reachin{interact.METHOD(EXPR_0, ..., EXPR_n)}, where @reachin{METHOD} is an identifier bound in the @tech{participant interact interface} to a function type, and @reachin{EXPR_0} through @reachin{EXPR_n} are @tech{expressions} that evaluates to the result of an @tech{interact}ion with a @tech{frontend} that receives the evaluation of the @reachin{n} @tech{expressions} and sends a @tech{value}.

An @tech{interaction expression} may also be written @reachin{interact.KEY}, where @reachin{KEY} is bound in the @tech{participant interact interface} to a non-function type.

An @tech{interaction expression} may only occur in a @tech{local step}.

@subsubsection{@tt{assume}}

@(mint-define! '("assume"))
@reach{
 assume( claim, [msg] ) }

@index{assume} An @tech{assumption} where @reachin{claim} evaluates to @reachin{true} with @tech{honest} @tech{frontends}.
This may only appear in a @tech{local step}.
It accepts an optional bytes argument, which is included in any reported violation.

@subsubsection{@tt{declassify}}

@(mint-define! '("declassify"))
@reach{
 declassify( arg ) }

The @deftech{declassify} primitive performs a @tech{declassification} of the given argument.

@subsubsection{@tt{makeCommitment}}

@(mint-define! '("makeCommitment"))
@reach{
 makeCommitment( interact, x ) }

@index{makeCommitment} Returns two values, @reachin{[ commitment, salt ]}, where @reachin{salt} is the result of calling @reachin{interact.random()}, and
@reachin{commitment} is the @tech{digest} of @reachin{salt} and @reachin{x}.
This is used in a @tech{local step} before @reachin{checkCommitment} is used in a @tech{consensus step}.

@section[#:tag "ref-programs-consensus"]{Consensus Steps}

A Reach @tech{consensus step} occurs in the @tech{continuation} of a @tech{consensus transfer} statement.
It represents the actions taken by the @tech{consensus network} @tech{contract} of an application.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-consensus-stmts"]{Statements}

Any statements valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-stmts"]{computation} are valid for a consensus step.
However, some additional statements are allowed.

@subsubsection{@tt{commit}}

@(mint-define! '("commit"))
@reach{
 commit(); }

A @deftech{commit statement}, written @reachin{commit();}, @tech{commits} to @tech{statement}'s @tech{continuation} as the next @tech{step} of the @DApp computation. In other words, it ends the current @tech{consensus step} and allows more @tech{local steps}.

@subsubsection{@tt{Participant.set} and @tt{.set}}

@(mint-define! '("Participant"))
@reach{
 Participant.set(PART, ADDR);
 PART.set(ADDR); }

@index{Participant.set} Assigns the given @tech{participant} to the given address.
If a @tech{backend} is running for this @tech{participant} and its address does not match the given address, then it will abort.
This may only occur within a @tech{consensus step}.

@margin-note{@secref["workshop-relay"] is a good introductory project that demonstrates how to use this feature of Reach.}

@subsubsection{@tt{while}}

@(mint-define! '("while") '("var") '("invariant"))
@reach{
 var [ heap1, heap2 ] = [ 21, 21 ];
 invariant(balance() == 2 * wagerAmount);
 while ( heap1 + heap2 > 0 ) {
   ....
   [ heap1, heap2 ] = [ heap1 - 1, heap2 ];
   continue; } }

A @deftech{while statement} may occur within a @tech{consensus step} and is written:

@reach{
 var LHS = INIT_EXPR;
 invariant(INVARIANT_EXPR);
 while( COND_EXPR ) BLOCK }

where @reachin{LHS} is a valid left-hand side of an @tech{identifier definition} where the @tech{expression} @reachin{INIT_EXPR} is the right-hand side, and @reachin{INVARIANT_EXPR} is an @tech{expression}, called the @deftech{loop invariant}, that must be true before and after every execution of the @tech{block} @reachin{BLOCK}, and if @reachin{COND_EXPR} is true, then the @tech{block} executes, and if not, then the loop terminates and control transfers to the @tech{continuation} of the @tech{while statement}. The identifiers bound by @reachin{LHS} are bound within @reachin{INVARIANT_EXPR}, @reachin{COND_EXPR}, @reachin{BLOCK}, and the @tech{tail} of the @tech{while statement}.

@margin-note{Read about finding @seclink["guide-loop-invs"]{loop invariants} in the Reach guide.}

@subsubsection{@tt{continue}}

@(mint-define! '("continue"))
@reach{
 [ heap1, heap2 ] = [ heap1 - 1, heap2 ];
 continue; }

A @deftech{continue statement} may occur within a @tech{while statement}'s @tech{block} and is written:

@reach{
 LHS = UPDATE_EXPR;
 continue; }

where the identifiers bound by @reachin{LHS} are a subset of the variables bound by the nearest enclosing @tech{while statement} and @reachin{UPDATE_EXPR} is an @tech{expression} which may be bound by @reachin{LHS}.

A @tech{continue statement} is a @tech{terminator statement}, so it must have an empty @tech{tail}.

A @tech{continue statement} may be written without the preceding identifier update, which is equivalent to writing

@reach{
 [] = [];
 continue; }

A @tech{continue statement} must be dominated by a @tech{consensus transfer}, which means that the body of a @tech{while statement} must always @reachin{commit();} before calling @reachin{continue;}.
This restriction may be lifted in future versions of Reach, which will perform termination checking.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-consensus-exprs"]{Expressions}

Any expressions valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-exprs"]{computation} are valid for a consensus step.
However, some additional expressions are allowed.

@subsubsection{@tt{transfer}}

@(mint-define! '("transfer"))
@reach{
 transfer(10).to(Alice) }

A @deftech{transfer expression}, written @reachin{transfer(AMOUNT_EXPR).to(PART)}, where @reachin{AMOUNT_EXPR} is an @tech{expression} that evaluates to a natural number and @reachin{PART} is a @tech{participant} identifier, performs a @tech{transfer} of @tech{network tokens} from the @tech{contract} to the named @tech{participant}. @reachin{AMOUNT_EXPR} must evaluate to less than or equal to the balance of @tech{network tokens} in the @tech{contract} @tech{account}. A @tech{transfer expression} may only occur within a @tech{consensus step}.

@subsubsection{@tt{require}}

@(mint-define! '("require"))
@reach{
 require( claim, [msg] ) }

@index{require} A @tech{requirement} where @reachin{claim} evaluates to @reachin{true} with @tech{honest} @tech{participants}.
This may only appear in a @tech{consensus step}.
It accepts an optional bytes argument, which is included in any reported violation.

@subsubsection{@tt{checkCommitment}}

@(mint-define! '("checkCommitment"))
@reach{
 checkCommitment( commitment, salt, x ) }

@index{checkCommitment} Makes a @tech{requirement} that @reachin{commitment} is the @tech{digest} of @reachin{salt} and @reachin{x}.
This is used in a @tech{consensus step} after @reachin{makeCommitment} was used in a @tech{local step}.

@section[#:tag "ref-programs-compute"]{Computations}

This section describes the common features available in all Reach contexts.

@subsection{Comments}

@reach{
 // single-line comment
 /* multi-line
  * comment
  */ }

Comments are text that is ignored by the compiler.
Text starting with @litchar{//} up until the end of the line forms a @deftech{single-line comment}.
Text enclosed with @litchar{/*} and @litchar{*/} forms a @deftech{multi-line comment}.
It is @tech{invalid} to nest a @tech{multi-line comment} within a @tech{multi-line comment}.

@subsection{Blocks}

@reach{
  { return 42; }
  { const x = 31;
    return x + 11; }
  { if ( x < y ) {
      return "Why";
    } else {
      return "Ecks"; } } }

A @deftech{block} is a sequence of @tech{statements} surrounded by braces, i.e. @litchar["{"] and @litchar["}"].

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-compute-stmts"]{Statements}

This section describes the @deftech{statements} which are allowed in any Reach context.

Each @tech{statement} affects the meaning of the subsequent @tech{statements}, which is called its @deftech{tail}. For example, if @reachin{{X; Y; Z;}} is a @tech{block}, then @reachin{X}'s @tech{tail} is @reachin{{Y; Z;}} and @reachin{Y}'s @tech{tail} is @reachin{{Z;}}.

Distinct from @tech{tails} are @deftech{continuations} which include everything after the @tech{statement}. For example, in @reachin{{{X; Y;}; Z;}}, @reachin{X}'s @tech{tail} is just @reachin{Y}, but its @tech{continuation} is @reachin{{Y;}; Z;}.

@tech{Tails} are statically apparent from the structure of the program source code, while @tech{continuations} are influenced by function calls.

A sequence of @tech{statements} that does not end in a @deftech{terminator statement} (a @tech{statement} with no @tech{tail}), such as a @tech{return statement}, @tech{continue statement}, or @tech{exit statement} is treated as if it ended with @reachin{return null;}.

The remainder of this section enumerates each kind of @tech{statement}.

@subsubsection{@tt{const} and @tt{function}}

An @deftech{identifier definition} is either
a @tech{value definition}
or a @tech{function definition}.
Each of these introduces one or more @deftech{bound identifier}s.

@(hrule)

@(mint-define! '("const"))
@reach{
  const DELAY = 10;
  const [ Good, Bad ] = [ 42, 43 ];
  const { x, y } = { x: 1, y: 2 };
  const [ x, [ y ] ] = [ 1, [ 2 ] ];
  const [ x, { y } ] = [ 1, { y: 2 } ];
  const { x: [ a, b ] } = { x: [ 1, 2 ] };
  }
@margin-note{@tech{Valid} @deftech{identifiers} follow the same rules as JavaScript identifiers:
they may consist of Unicode alphanumeric characters,
or @reachin{_} or @reachin{$},
but may not begin with a digit.}

A @deftech{value definition} is written @reachin{const LHS = RHS;}.

@reachin{LHS} must obey the grammar:

@BNF[
(list
 @nonterm{LHS}
 @nonterm{id}
 @BNF-seq[@litchar["["] @nonterm{LHS-tuple-seq} @litchar["]"]]
 @BNF-seq[@litchar["{"] @nonterm{LHS-obj-seq} @litchar["}"]])
(list

@reachin{RHS} must be compatible with the given @reachin{LHS}.
That is, if a @reachin{LHS} is an @nonterm{LHS-tuple-seq}, then the corresponding @reachin{RHS} must be a tuple with the correct number of elements.
If a @reachin{LHS} is an @nonterm{LHS-obj-seq}, then the corresponding @reachin{RHS} must be an object with the correct fields.

Those @tech{values} are available as their corresponding @tech{bound identifier}s in the statement's @tech{tail}.

@(hrule)

@(mint-define! '("function"))
@reach{
  function randomBool() {
    return (interact.random() % 2) == 0; }; }

A @deftech{function definition}, written @reachin{function FUN(ARG_0, ..., ARG_n) BLOCK;}, defines @reachin{FUN} as a function which abstracts its @deftech{function body}, the @tech{block} @reachin{BLOCK}, over the left-hand sides @reachin{LHS_0} through @reachin{LHS_n}.

@(hrule)

All identifiers in Reach programs must be @deftech{unbound}
at the position of the program where they are bound,
i.e., it is @tech{invalid} to shadow identifiers with new definitions.
For example,

@reach{
 const x = 3;
 const x = 4; }

is @tech{invalid}.
This restriction is independent of whether a binding is
only known to a single @tech{participant}. For example,

@reach{
 Alice.only(() => {
   const x = 3; });
 Bob.only(() => {
   const x = 3; }); }

is @tech{invalid}.

The special identifier @reachin{_} is an exception to this rule.
The @reachin{_} binding is always considered to be unbound.
This means means that @reachin{_} is both
an identifier that can never be read,
as well as an identifier that may be bound many times.
This may be useful for ignoring unwanted values, for example:

@reach{
 const [_, x, _] = [1, 2, 3];
}

@subsubsection{@tt{return}}

@(mint-define! '("return"))
@reach{
 return 17;
 return 3 + 4;
 return f(2, false);
 return; }

A @deftech{return statement}, written @reachin{return EXPR;}, where @reachin{EXPR} is an @tech{expression} evaluates to the same @tech{value} as @reachin{EXPR}.
As a special case, @reachin{return;} is interpreted the same as @reachin{return null;}.

A @tech{return statement} returns its value to the surrounding function application.

A @tech{return statement} is a @tech{terminator statement}, so it must have an empty @tech{tail}. For example,

@reach{
 { return 1;
   return 2; } }

is @tech{invalid}, because the first @reachin{return}'s @tech{tail} is not empty.

@subsubsection{@tt{if}}

@(mint-define! '("if") '("else"))
@reach{
 if ( 1 + 2 < 3 ) {
   return "Yes!";
 } else {
   return "No, waaah!"; } }

A @deftech{conditional statement},
written @reachin{if (COND) NOT_FALSE else FALSE},
where @reachin{COND} is an @tech{expression}
and @reachin{NOT_FALSE} and @reachin{FALSE} as @tech{statements}
(potentially @tech{block statements}),
selects between the @reachin{NOT_FALSE} @tech{statement} and @reachin{FALSE} @tech{statement} based on whether @reachin{COND} evaluates to @reachin{false}.

Both @reachin{NOT_FALSE} and @reachin{FALSE} have empty @tech{tails}, i.e. the @tech{tail} of the @tech{conditional statement} is not propagated. For example,

@reach{
 if ( x < y ) {
   const z = 3; }
 else {
   const z = 4; }
 return z; }

is erroneous, because the identifier @reachin{z} is not bound outside the @tech{conditional statement}.

A @tech{conditional statement} may only include a @tech{consensus transfer} in @reachin{NOT_FALSE} or @reachin{FALSE} if it is within a @tech{consensus step}, because its statements are in the same context as the conditional statement itself.

@subsubsection{@tt{switch}}

@(mint-define! '("switch") '("case") '("default"))
@reach{
 const mi = Maybe(UInt).Some(42);
 switch ( mi ) {
  case None: return 8;
  case Some: return mi + 10; }
 switch ( mi ) {
  case None: return 8;
  default: return 41; } }

A @deftech{switch statement},
written @reachin{switch (VAR) { CASE ... }},
where @reachin{VAR} is a variable bound to a @tech{data instance}
and @reachin{CASE} is either @reachin{case VARIANT: STMT ...}, where @reachin{VARIANT} is a variant, or @reachin{default: STMT ...}, @reachin{STMT} is a sequence of statements,
selects the appropriate sequence of statements based on which variant @reachin{VAR} holds.
Within the body of a @reachin{switch} case, @reachin{VAR} has the type of variant; i.e. in a @reachin{Some} case of a @reachin{Maybe(UInt)} @reachin{switch}, the variable is bound to an integer.

All cases have empty @tech{tails}, i.e. the @tech{tail} of the @tech{switch statement} is not propagated.

A @tech{switch statement} may only include a @tech{consensus transfer} in its cases if it is within a @tech{consensus step}, because its statements are in the same context as the conditional statement itself.

It is @tech{invalid} for a case to appear multiple times, or be missing, or to be superfluous (i.e. for a variant that does not exist in the @reachin{Data} type of @reachin{VAR}).

@subsubsection{Block statements}

A @deftech{block statement} is when a @tech{block} occurs in a @tech{statement} position, then it establishes a local, separate scope for the definitions of identifiers within that @tech{block}. In other words, the @tech{block} is evaluated for effect, but the @tech{tail} of the @tech{statements} within the @tech{block} are isolated from the surrounding @tech{tail}. For example,

@reach{
 const x = 4;
 return x; }

evaluates to @reachin{4}, but

@reach{
 { const x = 4; }
 return x; }

is erroneous, because the identifier @reachin{x} is not bound outside the @tech{block statement}.

@subsubsection{Expression statements}

@reach{
 4;
 f(2, true); }

An @tech{expression}, @reachin{E}, in a @tech{statement} position is equivalent to the @tech{block statement} @reachin{{ return E; }}.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-compute-exprs"]{Expressions}

This section describes the expressions which are allowed in any Reach context.
There are a large variety of different @deftech{expressions} in Reach programs.

The remainder of this section enumerates each kind of @tech{expression}.

@subsubsection{Identifier reference}

@reach{
 X
 Y
 Z }

An identifier, written @reachin{ID}, is an @tech{expression} that evaluates to the value of the @tech{bound identifier}.

@subsubsection{Function application}

@reach{
 assert( amount <= heap1 )
 step( moveA )
 digest( coinFlip )
 interact.random()
 declassify( _coinFlip ) }

A @deftech{function application}, written @reachin{EXPR_rator(EXPR_rand_0, ..., EXPR_rand_n)}, where @reachin{EXPR_rator} and @reachin{EXPR_rand_0} through @reachin{EXPR_rand_n} are @tech{expressions} that evaluate to one value.
@reachin{EXPR_rator} must evaluate to an abstraction over @reachin{n} values or a primitive of arity @reachin{n}.
A spread expression (@reachin{...expr}) may appear in the list of operands to a function application, in which case the elements of the expr are spliced in place.

@subsubsection{Types}

Reach's @deftech{type}s are represented with programs by the following identifiers and constructors:

@itemlist[
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Null")) @reachin{Null}.}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Bool")) @reachin{Bool}, which denotes a boolean.}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("UInt")) @reachin{UInt}, which denotes an unsigned integer.
  @reachin{UInt.max} is the largest value that may be assigned to a @reachin{UInt}.}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Bytes")) @reachin{Bytes(length)}, which denotes a string of bytes of length at most @reachin{length}.}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Digest")) @reachin{Digest}, which denotes a @tech{digest}.}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Address")) @reachin{Address}, which denotes an @tech{account} @tech{address}.}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Fun")) @reachin{Fun([Domain_0, ..., Domain_N], Range)}, which denotes a function type.}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Tuple")) @reachin{Tuple(Field_0, ..., FieldN)}, which denotes a tuple.
  (Refer to @secref["ref-programs-tuples"] for constructing tuples.)}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Object")) @reachin{Object({key_0: Type_0, ..., key_N: Type_N})}, which denotes an object.
  (Refer to @secref["ref-programs-objects"] for constructing objects.)}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Array")) @reachin{Array(ElementType, size)}, which denotes a statically-sized array.
  (Refer to @secref["ref-programs-arrays"] for constructing arrays.)}
  @item{@(mint-define! '("Data")) @reachin{Data({variant_0: Type_0, ..., variant_N: Type_N})}, which denotes a @link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union"]{tagged union} (or @emph{sum type}).
  (Refer to @secref["ref-programs-data"] for constructing @tech{data instances}.)}
]

@reachin{Object} and @reachin{Data} are commonly used to implemented @link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type"]{algebraic data types} in Reach.

@(mint-define! '("typeOf") '("isType"))
@reach{
 typeOf(x)  // type
 isType(t) // Bool
}

The @reachin{typeOf} primitive function is the same as @reachin{typeof}:
it returns the type of its argument.
The @reachin{isType} function returns @reachin{true} if its argument is a type.
Any expression satisfying @reachin{isType} is compiled away and does not exist at runtime.

@subsubsection{Literal values}

@(mint-define! '("true") '("false") '("null"))
@reach{
 10
 0xdeadbeef
 007
 true
 false
 null
 "reality bytes"
 'it just does' }

A @deftech{literal value},
written @reachin{VALUE},
is an @tech{expression} that evaluates to the given @tech{value}.

The @deftech{null literal} may be written as @reachin{null}.

@deftech{Numeric literal}s may be written in decimal, hexadecimal, or octal.
Numeric literals must obey the @deftech{bit width} of @reachin{UInt} if they are used as @reachin{UInt} values at runtime, but if they only appear at compile-time, then they may be any number.

@deftech{Boolean literal}s may be written as @reachin{true} or @reachin{false}.

@deftech{String literal}s (aka byte strings)
may be written between double or single quotes
(with no distinction between the different styles)
and use the same escaping rules as JavaScript.

@subsubsection{Operator expression}

An @deftech{operator} is a special identifier,
which is either a @tech{unary operator}, or a @tech{binary operator}.

@(hrule)

@(mint-define! '("!") '("-") '("typeof"))
@reach{
 ! a
 - a
 typeof a}

A @deftech{unary expression}, written @reachin{UNAOP EXPR_rhs}, where @reachin{EXPR_rhs} is an @tech{expression} and @reachin{UNAOP} is one of the @deftech{unary operator}s: @litchar{! - typeof}.

It is @tech{invalid} to use unary operations on the wrong types of @tech{values}.

@(hrule)

@(mint-define! '("&" "&") '("||") '("+") '("-") '("*") '("/") '("%") '("|") '("&") '("^") '("<" "<") '(">" ">") '("==") '("!=") '("===") '("!==") '(">") '(">" "=") '("<" "=") '("<"))
@reach{
 a && b
 a || b
 a + b
 a - b
 a * b
 a / b
 a % b
 a | b
 a & b
 a ^ b
 a << b
 a >> b
 a == b
 a != b
 a === b
 a !== b
 a > b
 a >= b
 a <= b
 a < b }

@margin-note{Bitwise operations are not supported by all @tech{consensus networks} and greatly decrease the efficiency of verification.}

A @deftech{binary expression}, written @reachin{EXPR_lhs BINOP EXPR_rhs}, where @reachin{EXPR_lhs} and @reachin{EXPR_rhs} are @tech{expressions} and @reachin{BINOP} is one of the @deftech{binary operator}s: @litchar{&& || + - * / % | & ^ << >> == != === !== > >= <= <}.
The operators @reachin{==} (and @reachin{===}) and @reachin{!=} (and @reachin{!==}) operate on all atomic values.
Numeric operations, like @reachin{+} and @reachin{>}, only operate on numbers.
Since all numbers in Reach are integers, operations like @reachin{/} truncate their result.
Boolean operations, like @reachin{&&}, only operate on booleans.
It is @tech{invalid} to use binary operations on the wrong types of @tech{values}.

@(mint-define! '("and") '("or") '("add") '("sub") '("mul") '("div") '("mod") '("lt") '("le") '("ge") '("gt") '("lsh") '("rsh") '("band") '("bior") '("band") '("bxor") '("polyEq") '("polyNeq"))
@reach{
 and(a, b)     // &&
 or(a, b)      // ||
 add(a, b)     // +
 sub(a, b)     // -
 mul(a, b)     // *
 div(a, b)     // /
 mod(a, b)     // %
 lt(a, b)      // <
 le(a, b)      // <=
 ge(a, b)      // >=
 gt(a, b)      // >
 lsh(a, b)     // <<
 rsh(a, b)     // >>
 band(a, b)    // &
 bior(a, b)    // |
 bxor(a, b)    // ^
 polyEq(a, b)  // ==, ===
 polyNeq(a, b) // !=, !==
}

All @tech{binary expression} operators have a corresponding named function in the standard library.
While @reachin{&&} and @reachin{||} may not evaluate their second argument,
their corresponding named functions @reachin{and} and @reachin{or}, always do.

@(mint-define! '("boolEq") '("typeEq") '("intEq") '("digestEq") '("addressEq"))
@reach{
 polyEq(a, b)    // eq on Bool, types, or UInt
 boolEq(a, b)    // eq on Bool
 typeEq(a, b)    // eq on types
 intEq(a, b)     // eq on UInt
 digestEq(a, b)  // eq on Digest
 addressEq(a, b) // eq on Addresses
}

@reachin{==} is a function which operates on multiple types.
Both arguments must be of the same type.
Specialized functions exist for equality checking on each supported type.

@(hrule)

If @reachin{verifyOverflow} is @reachin{true}, then operations automatically make a @tech{static assertion} that their arguments would not overflow the @tech{bit width} of the enable @tech{consensus networks}.
If it is @reachin{false}, then the @tech{connector} will ensure this dynamically.

@subsubsection{Parenthesized expression}

@reach{
 (a + b) - c }

An @tech{expression} may be parenthesized, as in @reachin{(EXPR)}.

@subsubsection[#:tag "ref-programs-tuples"]{Tuples}

@reach{
 [ ]
 [ 1, 2 + 3, 4 * 5 ] }

A @deftech{tuple} literal, written @reachin{[ EXPR_0, ..., EXPR_n ]}, is an @tech{expression} which evaluates to a tuple of @reachin{n} values, where @reachin{EXPR_0} through @reachin{EXPR_n} are @tech{expressions}.

@reachin{...expr} may appear inside tuple expressions, in which case the spreaded expression must evaluate to a tuple or array, which is spliced in place.

@subsubsection[#:tag "ref-programs-arrays"]{@tt{array}}

@(mint-define! '("array"))
@reach{
  const x = array(UInt, [1, 2, 3]); }

Converts a @tech{tuple} of homogeneous values of the specific type into an @deftech{array}.

@subsubsection{Element reference}

@reach{
 arr[3] }

A @deftech{reference}, written @reachin{REF_EXPR[IDX_EXPR]},
where @reachin{REF_EXPR} is an @tech{expression} that evaluates to an @tech{array} or a @tech{tuple}
and @reachin{IDX_EXPR} is an @tech{expression} that evaluates to a natural number which is less than the size of the array,
selects the element at the given index of the array.
Indices start at zero.

@subsubsection{Array & tuple length: @tt{Tuple.length}, @tt{Array.length}, and @tt{.length}}

@(mint-define! '("length"))
@reach{
 Tuple.length(tup);
 tup.length;
 Array.length(arr);
 arr.length; }

@index{Tuple.length} @reachin{Tuple.length} Returns the length of the given tuple.

@index{Array.length} @reachin{Array.length} Returns the length of the given array.

Both may be abbreviated as @reachin{expr.length} where @reachin{expr} evaluates to a tuple or an array.

@subsubsection{Array & tuple update: @tt{Tuple.set}, @tt{Array.set}, and @tt{.set}}

@(mint-define! '("set"))
@reach{
 Tuple.set(tup, idx, val);
 tup.set(idx, val);
 Array.set(arr, idx, val);
 arr.set(idx, val); }

@index{Tuple.set} @reachin{Tuple.set} Returns a new tuple identical to @reachin{tup},
except that index @reachin{idx} is replaced with @reachin{val}.

@index{Array.set} @reachin{Array.set} Returns a new array identical to @reachin{arr}, except that index @reachin{idx} is replaced with @reachin{val}.

Both may be abbreviated as @reachin{expr.set(idx, val)} where @reachin{expr} evaluates to a tuple or an array.

@subsubsection{Array group operations: @tt{Array.iota}, @tt{Array.concat} & @tt{.concat}, @tt{Array.empty}, @tt{Array.zip} & @tt{.zip}, @tt{Array.map} & @tt{.map}, @tt{Array.reduce} & @tt{.reduce}, @tt{Array.forEach} & @tt{.forEach}, and @tt{Array.replicate} }

@(mint-define! '("iota"))
@reach{
 Array.iota(5) }

@index{Array.iota} @reachin{Array.iota(len)} returns an array of length @reachin{len}, where each element is the same as its index.
For example, @reachin{Array.iota(4)} returns @reachin{[0, 1, 2, 3]}.
The given @reachin{len} must evaluate to an integer at compile-time.

@(mint-define! '("Array_replicate" "replicate"))
@reach{
 Array.replicate(5, "five")
 Array_replicate(5, "five") }

@index{Array.replicate} @reachin{Array.replicate(len, val)} returns an array of length @reachin{len}, where each element is @reachin{val}.
For example, @reachin{Array.replicate(4, "four")} returns @reachin{["four", "four", "four", "four"]}.
The given @reachin{len} must evaluate to an integer at compile-time.

@(mint-define! '("concat"))
@reach{
 Array.concat(x, y)
 x.concat(y) }

@index{Array.concat} @reachin{Array.concat(x, y)} concatenates the two arrays @reachin{x} and @reachin{y}.
This may be abbreviated as @reachin{x.concat(y)}.

@(mint-define! '("Array_empty" "empty"))
@reach{
 Array_empty
 Array.empty }

@index{Array.empty} @reachin{Array.empty} is an array with no elements.
It is the identity element of @reachin{Array.concat}.
It may also be written @reachin{Array_empty}.

@(mint-define! '("zip"))
@reach{
 Array.zip(x, y)
 x.zip(y) }

@index{Array.zip} @reachin{Array.zip(x, y)} returns a new array the same size as @reachin{x} and @reachin{y} (which must be the same size) whose elements are tuples of the elements of @reachin{x} and @reachin{y}.
This may be abbreviated as @reachin{x.zip(y)}.

@(mint-define! '("map"))
@reach{
 Array.map(arr, f)
 arr.map(f) }

@index{Array.map} @reachin{Array.map(arr, f)} returns a new array, @reachin{arr_mapped}, the same size as @reachin{arr}, where @reachin{arr_mapped[i] = f(arr[i])} for all @reachin{i}.
For example, @reachin{Array.iota(4).map(x => x+1)} returns @reachin{[1, 2, 3, 4]}.
This may be abbreviated as @reachin{arr.map(f)}.

This function is generalized to an arbitrary number of arrays of the same size, which are provided before the @reachin{f} argument.
For example, @reachin{Array.iota(4).map(Array.iota(4), add)} returns @reachin{[0, 2, 4, 6]}.

@(mint-define! '("reduce"))
@reach{
 Array.reduce(arr, z, f)
 arr.reduce(z, f) }

@index{Array.reduce} @reachin{Array.reduce(arr, z, f)} returns the @link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)"]{left fold} of the function @reachin{f} over the given array with the initial value @reachin{z}.
For example, @reachin{Array.iota(4).reduce(0, add)} returns @reachin{((0 + 1) + 2) + 3 = 6}.
This may be abbreviated as @reachin{arr.reduce(z, f)}.

This function is generalized to an arbitrary number of arrays of the same size, which are provided before the @reachin{z} argument.
For example, @reachin{Array.iota(4).reduce(Array.iota(4), 0, (x, y, z) => (z + x + y))} returns @reachin{((((0 + 0 + 0) + 1 + 1) + 2 + 2) + 3 + 3)}.

@(mint-define! '("Array_forEach") '("Array_forEach1") '("forEach"))
@reach{
 arr.forEach(f)
 Array.forEach(arr, f)
 Array_forEach(arr, f)
 Array_forEach1(arr)(f) }

@index{Array.forEach} @reachin{Array.forEach(arr, f)} iterates the function @reachin{f} over the elements of the array @reachin{arr}, discarding the result.
This may be abbreviated as @reachin{arr.forEach(f)}.

@subsubsection[#:tag "ref-programs-objects"]{Objects}

@reach{
  { }
  { x: 3, "yo-yo": 4 }
  { [1 < 2 ? "one" : "two"]: 5 }
}

An @deftech{object literal},
typically written @reachin{{ KEY_0: EXPR_0, ..., KEY_n: EXPR_n }},
where @reachin{KEY_0} through @reachin{KEY_n} are @tech{identifiers} or @tech{string literal}s
and @reachin{EXPR_0} through @reachin{EXPR_n} are @tech{expressions},
is an @tech{expression} which evaluates to an @deftech{object}
with fields @reachin{KEY_0} through @reachin{KEY_n}.

Additional object literal syntax exists for convenience, such as:

@reach{
  { ...obj, z: 5 }
}

An @deftech{object splice},
where all fields from @reachin{obj} are copied into the object;
these fields may be accompanied by additional fields specified afterwards.

@reach{
  { x, z: 5 }
}

Shorthand for @reachin{{ x: x, z: 5}}, where @reachin{x} is any @tech{bound identifier}.

@subsubsection{Field reference}

@reach{
  obj.x
}

An @deftech{object reference},
written @reachin{OBJ.FIELD},
where @reachin{OBJ} is an expression of type object,
and @reachin{FIELD} is a @tech{valid} @tech{identifier},
accesses the FIELD @deftech{field} of object OBJ.

@subsubsection{@tt{Object.set}}

@(mint-define! '("Object_set"))
@reach{
 Object.set(obj, fld, val);
 Object_set(obj, fld, val);
 { ...obj, [fld]: val };
}

@index{Object.set} Returns a new object identical to @reachin{obj},
except that field @reachin{fld} is replaced with @reachin{val}.

@subsubsection[#:tag "ref-programs-data"]{Data}

@reach{
 const Taste = Data({Salty: Null,
                     Spicy: Null,
                     Sweet: Null,
                     Umami: Null});
 const burger = Taste.Umami();

 const Shape = Data({ Circle: Object({r: UInt}),
                      Square: Object({s: UInt}),
                      Rect: Object({w: UInt, h: UInt}) });
 const nice = Shape.Circle({r: 5}); }

A @deftech{data instance} is written @reachin{DATA.VARIANT(VALUE)}, where @reachin{DATA} is @reachin{Data} type, @reachin{VARIANT} is the name of one of @reachin{DATA}'s variants, and @reachin{VALUE} is a value matching the type of the variant.
As a special case, when the type of a variant is @reachin{Null}, the @reachin{VALUE} may be omitted, as shown in the definition of @reachin{burger} in the same above.

@tech{Data instances} are consumed by @reachin{switch} statements.

@subsubsection{@tt{Maybe}}

@(mint-define! '("Maybe") '("Some") '("None") '("fromMaybe"))
@reach{
 const MayInt = Maybe(UInt);
 const bidA = MayInt.Some(42);
 const bidB = MayInt.None(null);

 const getBid = (m) => fromMaybe(m, (() => 0), ((x) => x));
 const bidSum = getBid(bidA) + getBid(bidB);
 assert(bidSum == 42); }

@link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type"]{Option types} are represented in Reach through the built-in @reachin{Data} type, @reachin{Maybe}, which has two variants: @reachin{Some} and @reachin{None}.

@reachin{Maybe} is defined by
@reach{
 export const Maybe = (A) => Data({None: Null, Some: A}); }

This means it is a function that returns a @reachin{Data} type specialized to a particular type in the @reachin{Some} variant.

@reachin{Maybe} instances can be conveniently consumed by @reachin{fromMaybe(mValue, onNone, onSome)}, where @reachin{onNone} is a function of no arguments which is called when @reachin{mValue} is @reachin{None}, @reachin{onSome} is a function of on argument which is called with the value when @reachin{mValue} is @reachin{Some}, and @reachin{mValue} is a @tech{data instance} of @reachin{Maybe}.

@subsubsection{@tt{match}}

@reach{
 const Value = Data({
    EBool: Bool,
    EInt: UInt,
    ENull: Null,
  });
  const v1 = Value.EBool(true);
  const v2 = Value.EInt(200);
  const isTruthy = (v) =>
    v.match({
      EBool: (b) => { return b },
      EInt : (i) => { return i != 0 },
      ENull: ()  => { return false }
    });

  assert(isTruthy(v1));
  assert(isTruthy(v2));
}

A match expression, written @tt{VAR.match({ CASE ... })}, where @tt{VAR} is a variable
bound to a @tech{data instance} and @tt{CASE} is @tt{VARIANT: FUNCTION}, where @tt{VARIANT} is a
variant, and @tt{FUNCTION} is a function that takes the same parameters as the
variant constructor, or no parameters if the variant has a type of @tt{Null}.

@tt{match} is similar to a @@tech{switch statement}, but since it is an expression, it
can be conveniently used in places like the right hand side of an assignment statement.

Similar to a @tech{switch statement}, the cases are expected to be exhaustive and nonredundant,
all cases have empty @@tech{tails}, and it may only include a @@tech{consensus transfer} in
its cases if it is within a @@tech{consensus step}.

@subsubsection{Conditional expression}

@(mint-define! '("?"))
@reach{
 choosesFirst ? [ heap1 - amount, heap2 ] : [ heap1, heap2 - amount ] }

A @deftech{conditional expression}, written @reachin{COND_E ? NOT_FALSE_E : FALSE_E}, where @reachin{COND_E}, @reachin{NOT_FALSE_E}, and @reachin{FALSE_E} are @tech{expressions}, selects between the @tech{values} which @reachin{NOT_FALSE_E} and @reachin{FALSE_E} evaluate to based on whether @reachin{COND_E} evaluates to @reachin{false}.

@(mint-define! '("ite"))
@reach{
 ite(choosesFirst, [heap1 - amount, heap2], [heap1, heap2 - amount])
}

@tech{Conditional expression}s may also be written with the @reachin{ite} function,
however, note that this function always evaluates both of its branches,
while the regular conditional expression only evaluates one branch.

@subsubsection{Arrow expression}

@(mint-define! '("=" ">"))
@reach{
 (() => 4)
 ((x) => x + 1)
 ((x) => { const y = x + 1;
           return y + 1; })
 ((x, y) => { assert(x + y == 3); })(1, 2);
 ((x, y) => { assert(x + y == 3); })(...[1, 2]);
 (([x, y]) => { assert(x + y == 3); })([1, 2]);
 (({x, y}) => { assert(x + y == 3); })({x: 1, y: 2});
 (([x, [y]]) => { assert(x + y == 3); })([1,[2]]);
 (([x, {y}]) => { assert(x + y == 3); })([1,{ y: 2 }]);
}

An @deftech{arrow expression}, written @reachin{(LHS_0, ..., LHS_n) => EXPR}, where @reachin{LHS_0} through @reachin{LHS_n} are left-hand sides and @reachin{EXPR} is an @tech{expression}, evaluates to an function which is an abstraction of @reachin{EXPR} over @reachin{n} values compatible with the respective left-hand side.

@subsubsection{@tt{makeEnum}}

@(mint-define! '("makeEnum"))
@reach{
  const [ isHand, ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS ] = makeEnum(3); }

An @deftech{enumeration} (or @deftech{enum}, for short),
can be created by calling the @reachin{makeEnum} function, as in @reachin{makeEnum(N)},
where @reachin{N} is the number of distinct values in the enum.
This produces a tuple of @reachin{N+1} values,
where the first value is a @reachin{Fun([UInt], Bool)}
which tells you if its argument is one of the enum's values,
and the next N values are distinct @reachin{UInt}s.

@subsubsection{@tt{assert}}

@(mint-define! '("assert"))
@reach{
 assert( claim, [msg] ) }

@index{assert} A @tech{static assertion} which is only @tech{valid} if @reachin{claim} always evaluates to @reachin{true}.
@margin-note{The Reach compiler will produce a counter-example (i.e. an assignment of the identifiers in the program to falsify the @reachin{claim}) when an @tech{invalid} @reachin{claim} is provided.
It is possible to write a @reachin{claim} that actually always evaluates to @reachin{true}, but for which our current approach cannot prove always evaluates to @reachin{true}; if this is the case, Reach will fail to compile the program, reporting that its analysis is incomplete.
Reach will never produce an erroneous counter-example.}
It accepts an optional bytes argument, which is included in any reported violation.

@margin-note{See @seclink["guide-assert"]{the guide section on verification} to better understand how and what to verify in your program.}

@subsubsection{@tt{forall}}

@(mint-define! '("forall"))
@reach{
 forall( Type )
 forall( Type, (var) => BLOCK ) }

@index{forall} The single argument version returns an abstract value of the given type.
It may only be referenced inside of @tech{assert}ions; any other reference is invalid.

The two argument version is an abbreviation of calling the second argument with the result of @reachin{forall(Type)}.
This is convenient for writing general claims about expressions, such as

@reach{
 forall(UInt, (x) => assert(x == x)); }

@subsubsection{@tt{possible}}

@(mint-define! '("possible"))
@reach{
 possible( claim, [msg] ) }

@index{possible} A @tech{possibility assertion} which is only @tech{valid} if it is possible for @reachin{claim} to evaluate to @reachin{true} with @tech{honest} @tech{frontends} and @tech{participants}.
It accepts an optional bytes argument, which is included in any reported violation.

@subsubsection{@tt{digest}}

@(mint-define! '("digest"))
@reach{
 digest( arg_0, ..., arg_n ) }

The @tech{digest} primitive performs a @link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"]{cryptographic hash} of the binary encoding of the given arguments.
This returns a @reachin{Digest} value.
The exact algorithm used depends on the @tech{connector}.

@subsubsection{@tt{balance}}

@(mint-define! '("balance"))
@reach{
 balance() }

The @deftech{balance} primitive returns the balance of the @tech{contract} @tech{account} for the @|DApp|.

@subsubsection{@tt{implies}}

@(mint-define! '("implies"))
@reach{
 implies( x, y ) }

@index{implies} Returns @reachin{true} if @reachin{x} is @reachin{false} or @reachin{y} is @reachin{true}.

@subsubsection{@tt{ensure}}

@(mint-define! '("ensure"))
@reach{
 ensure( pred, x ) }

@index{ensure} Makes a @tech{static assertion} that @reachin{pred(x)} is @reachin{true} and returns @reachin{x}.

@subsubsection{@tt{hasRandom}}

@(mint-define! '("hasRandom"))
@reach{
 hasRandom }

@index{hasRandom} A @tech{participant interact interface} which specifies @litchar{random} as a function that takes no arguments and returns an unsigned integer of @tech{bit width} bits.
