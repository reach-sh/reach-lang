**Describe the error**

Please describe the error you experienced.

**To Reproduce**

Please include the program(s) that produce the unexpected behavior from Reach. If the error is in the compiler or during verification, you just need to include the `.rsh` file. If it is while the program is running, you should also include the `.mjs` file. It is easiest to link the file after posting them on `gist.github.com`, but if you don't want to share them publicly, please contact Jay McCarthy on our Discord server --- https://discord.gg/AZsgcXu --- and get them to him privately or he can help you reduce the code.

**Expected behavior**

Please describe what you expected or hoped would happen.

**Extra information**

What version of Reach are you using? You can run `reach version` or `reach hashes` to find out.
