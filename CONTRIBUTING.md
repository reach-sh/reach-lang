# Contributing to Reach

Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute to Reach!

If you have any problems or questions along the way, please contact us on our Discord server --- https://discord.gg/AZsgcXu --- for any reason.

# Code organization

Reach uses a monorepo and has top-level directories that correspond to the different components of the system. For example, the `hs` directory is where the compiler is and the `js` directory is where the runtime system for JavaScript is.

# Contributions

Please submit problems and feature requests as issues.

Please submit code additions as pull requests.

Feel free to talk on Discord about your ideas and first project options. A great first project is to build a new testing example or a new RPC client.
