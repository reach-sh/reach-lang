WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but the conservative analysis found these potential problems:
 * This program could use 2056 bytes of logs, but the limit is 1024; longest path:
     TOP --> preamble --> publish --> l1_publish_lt_3 --> publish2 --> updateState --> apiReturn --> checkSize --> done --> BOT

WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but we can statically determine that this program will not work on Algorand, because:
 * Step 1's argument length is 2049, but the maximum is 2048. Step 1 begins at ./index.rsh:27:5:dot
 * Step 2's argument length is 2049, but the maximum is 2048. Step 2 begins at ./index.rsh:38:5:dot
 * This program uses a remote object at ./index.rsh:49:9:application
