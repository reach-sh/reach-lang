WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but the conservative analysis found these potential problems:
 * Step 1 calls a remote object at ./index.rsh:45:39:application. This means that Reach's conservative analysis of resource utilization and fees is incorrect, because we cannot take into account the needs of the remote object.
 * Step 1 calls a remote object at ./index.rsh:46:39:application. This means that Reach's conservative analysis of resource utilization and fees is incorrect, because we cannot take into account the needs of the remote object.
 * Step 1 calls a remote object at ./index.rsh:47:39:application. This means that Reach's conservative analysis of resource utilization and fees is incorrect, because we cannot take into account the needs of the remote object.
 * Step 1 calls a remote object at ./index.rsh:48:39:application. This means that Reach's conservative analysis of resource utilization and fees is incorrect, because we cannot take into account the needs of the remote object.
