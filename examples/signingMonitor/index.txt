WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but the conservative analysis found these potential problems:
 * This program uses 'ALGOExitMode: DeleteAndCloseOutAll_SoundASAs_UnsoundElse' (the default) _and_ creates Map entries and Reach cannot guarantee that these closed at application exit, but we are generating a close out anyways. If those resources are not freed, then this close out will fail and the final transaction will always be rejected.
