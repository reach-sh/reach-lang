Verifying knowledge assertions

  Theorem formalization:
  v4

  This could be violated if...
    "v3" = 0
      (from: v3)
      (bound at: ./assert_gt.rsh:6:31:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."getX"())

  In context...
    "v4" = (> v3 0 )
      (from: v4)
      (bound at: ./assert_gt.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PGT(v3, 0 ))
