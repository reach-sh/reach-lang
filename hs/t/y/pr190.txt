WARNING: The Solidity compiler, run with optimization, fails on this program, but succeeds without optimization. This indicates a problem with Solidity that Reach is not working around; typically, because it is not possible to do so. You could report this error to Solidity (or Reach). If you do so, this is the message from Solidity:
Compiler error: Stack too deep. Try compiling with `--via-ir` (cli) or the equivalent `viaIR: true` (standard JSON) while enabling the optimizer. Otherwise, try removing local variables. When compiling inline assembly: Variable dataEnd is 1 slot(s) too deep inside the stack. Stack too deep. Try compiling with `--via-ir` (cli) or the equivalent `viaIR: true` (standard JSON) while enabling the optimizer. Otherwise, try removing local variables.
