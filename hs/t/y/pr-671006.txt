WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but the conservative analysis found these potential problems:
 * This program was compiled with trustworthy maps, but maps are not trustworthy on Algorand, because they are represented with local state. A user can delete their local state at any time, by sending a ClearState transaction. The only way to use local state properly on Algorand is to ensure that a user doing this can only 'hurt' themselves and not the entire system.
