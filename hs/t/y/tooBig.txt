WARNING: The Solidity compiler, run with optimization, fails on this program, but succeeds without optimization. This indicates a problem with Solidity that Reach is not working around; typically, because it is not possible to do so. You could report this error to Solidity (or Reach). If you do so, this is the message from Solidity:
The bytecode exceeds the maximum limit; it is 49068, but the limit is 24576
