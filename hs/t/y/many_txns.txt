WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but the conservative analysis found these potential problems:
 * Step 0 may use up to 16 assets, but the limit is 8. Step 0 starts at ./many_txns.rsh:62:5:dot.
 * Step 0 may use up to 17 transaction references, but the limit is 8. Step 0 starts at ./many_txns.rsh:62:5:dot.
 * Step 1 may use up to 16 assets, but the limit is 8. Step 1 starts at ./many_txns.rsh:99:5:dot.
 * Step 1 may use up to 18 transaction references, but the limit is 8. Step 1 starts at ./many_txns.rsh:99:5:dot.
WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but we can statically determine that this program will not work on Algorand, because:
 * Step 0 uses 18 input transactions, but the limit is 16. Step 0 starts at ./many_txns.rsh:62:5:dot.
 * Step 1 uses 18 input transactions, but the limit is 16. Step 1 starts at ./many_txns.rsh:99:5:dot.
