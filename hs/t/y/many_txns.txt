WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but the conservative analysis found these potential problems:
 * This program could use 2699 units of cost, but the limit is 700; longest path:
     TOP --> preamble --> api --> publish --> publish0 --> updateState --> apiReturn --> checkSize --> done --> BOT

WARNING: Compiler instructed to emit for Algorand, but we can statically determine that this program will not work on Algorand, because:
 * Step 0 (the one starting from the consensus transfer at ./many_txns.rsh:13:5:dot) could have too many inner transactions: could have 257 but limit is 256
