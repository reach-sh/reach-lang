        -- This pass duplicates continuations and inlines function calls. (We
        -- ALSO inline function calls during Eval, but we can't do that for
        -- ones that do communication). So the program looks like:

        -- }
        --
        -- This is needed because control-flow and functions are hard for
        -- multiple parts of our compiler to deal with.
        --
        -- First, it is hard for the SMT solver to deal with because we need to
        -- give each variable a unique identifier, so we can't reason about
        -- stacks there. We could linearize there instead if we wanted.
        --
        -- Second, it is hard for end-point projection, because we need to
        -- discover what program state is available at every point. We could
        -- deal with this by making EPP know about stacks.
        --
        -- = defluid
        --
        -- Because it is doing this, linearize ALSO implements fluid-variables
        -- (like `fluid-let` or `parameterize` in Racket). This is used to
        -- store things like the contract balance and the current time. In the
        -- DL program, those things look like `FluidRef(balance)` and
        -- `FluidSet(balance, 55)`, but afterwards are transformed to `v77` and
        -- `let v78 = 55` (and subsequent uses of `balance` become `v78`).
        --
        -- = liftcon
        --
        -- Finally, this pass ALSO moves things up out of "steps" into
        -- "consensus steps", because variables bound in a "step" could have
        -- been defined in consensus and are probably actually used in them.
        -- For example:
        --
        -- let x = 44
        -- commit()
        -- let y = x + 2
        -- publish(z)
        -- check(z == y + x)
        --
        -- We turn that into
        --
        -- let x = 44
        -- let y = x + 2
        -- commit()
        -- publish(z)
        -- check(z == y + x)
        --
        -- Because EPP will only allow consensus steps to use variables defined
        -- in them. It is maybe plausible that the value could be push DOWN
        -- rather than UP
        --
        -- let x = 44
        -- commit()
        -- publish(z)
        -- let y = x + 2
        -- check(z == y + x)
        --
        -- But it doesn't work that way now. It is not apparent that one is
        -- always better than the other (not all uses will use both `x` and
        -- `y`). One thing we do know is that there is only one "UP" but there
        -- could be many "DOWN"s (because of forking and timeouts).
        --
        -- = freshen
        --
        -- Finally, finally, this pass also does alpha-varying of everything
        -- (because dekont can duplicate code) and produces the LL program AST,
        -- which is where we define most of the other work
