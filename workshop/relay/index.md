allowing a payer to transfer funds to another party before knowing their identity.\n  However, unlike in <a href=\"/workshop/hash-lock/#workshop-hash-lock\">Hash Lock</a>, we will use a technique that is safe against malicious miners.\n  One deployment of a decentralized application like this is as a \"gift card\" where a funder provides a fixed amount of currency to another without knowing their

tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#workshop-relay-pr\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a></h2>\n<p><i id=\"p_5\" class=\"pid\"></i>For this workshop, we'll provide some constraints on your solution and problem analysis, since we'd like you to explore writing a Reach program with a specific design.<a href=\"#p_5\" class=\"pid\">5</a></p>\n<p><i id=\"p_6\" class=\"pid\"></i>The overall purpose of this application is so that:<a href=\"#p_6\" class=\"pid\">6</a></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><i id=\"p_7\" class=\"pid\"></i>Alice can decide an amount of funds to provide.<a href=\"#p_7\" class=\"pid\">7</a></li>\n  <li>\n    <i id=\"p_8\" class=\"pid\"></i>Alice later decides who will have access to this by sharing a secret with them.\n    We call this person, Bob.<a href=\"#p_8\" class=\"pid\">8</a>\n  </li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_9\" class=\"pid\"></i>Bob can transfer the funds to wherever he'd like.<a href=\"#p_9\" class=\"pid\">9</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <i id=\"p_10\" class=\"pid\"></i>In <a href=\"/workshop/hash-lock/#workshop-hash-lock\">Hash Lock</a>, we designed the application so that the \"secret\" was a special number that the contract compared against a known digest to release the funds.\n  This approach was flawed, because when Bob used the secret to gain access, it was possible for anyone else to see the transaction and attempt to play it themselves.<a href=\"#p_10\" class=\"pid\">10</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <i id=\"p_11\" class=\"pid\"></i>In today's workshop, we'll use a crucial insight about decentralized applications: account ownership is fluid and account credentials are a form of secret knowledge that every consensus network builds in to their foundation.\n  With that in mind, let's use the following design:<a href=\"#p_11\" class=\"pid\">11</a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Alice will represent her secret as an account that is authorized to withdraw the funds.</strong></p>\n<p><i id=\"p_12\" class=\"pid\"></i>This is called a <span class=\"term\" id=\"term_relay%20account\">relay account</span>, because it exists temporarily to faciliate the relaying of funds from Alice to Bob.<a href=\"#p_12\" class=\"pid\">12</a></p>\n<p><i id=\"p_13\" class=\"pid\"></i>With this in mind, let's answer the questions:<a href=\"#p_13\" class=\"pid\">13</a></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><i id=\"p_14\" class=\"pid\"></i>Who are the principals of the application?<a href=\"#p_14\" class=\"pid\">14</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_15\" class=\"pid\"></i>What are the participants of the program?<a href=\"#p_15\" class=\"pid\">15</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_16\" class=\"pid\"></i>What information do they know at the start of the program?<a href=\"#p_16\" class=\"pid\">16</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_17\" class=\"pid\"></i>What information are they going to discover and use in the program?<a href=\"#p_17\" class=\"pid\">17</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_18\" class=\"pid\"></i>What funds change ownership during the application and how?<a href=\"#p_18\" class=\"pid\">18</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Write down the problem analysis of this program as a comment.</strong></p>\n<p><i id=\"p_19\" class=\"pid\"></i>Let's see how your answers compare to our answers:<a href=\"#p_19\" class=\"pid\">19</a></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><i id=\"p_20\" class=\"pid\"></i>This application involves two principals: Alice, who sends funds, and Bob, who receives funds.<a href=\"#p_20\" class=\"pid\">20</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_21\" class=\"pid\"></i>The program has two participants: Alice, who initiates the application, and the Relay, which transfers the funds to Bob.<a href=\"#p_21\" class=\"pid\">21</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_22\" class=\"pid\"></i>Alice starts knowing the amount she wants to transfer.<a href=\"#p_22\" class=\"pid\">22</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_23\" class=\"pid\"></i>Alice creates the Relay account, while the Relay account learns the address of Bob, who will receive the funds.<a href=\"#p_23\" class=\"pid\">23</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_24\" class=\"pid\"></i>The funds start with Alice and then move to Bob under the instruction of the Relay.<a href=\"#p_24\" class=\"pid\">24</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  <i id=\"p_25\" class=\"pid\"></i>The most surprising thing about this application is that Bob is not one of the participants in the application!\n  Of course, the Relay will actually run under the auspices of Bob, after Alice shares the account credentials with him, but there is a distinction in the program between Bob's identity and the Relay's.<a href=\"#p_25\" class=\"pid\">25</a>\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"workshop-relay-dd\" class=\"refHeader\">Data Definition<a aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\" href=\"#workshop-relay-dd\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a></h2>\n<p>\n  <i id=\"p_26\" class=\"pid\"></i>The next step of designing our program is representing this information in our program and deciding the participant interact interface for each participant.\n  Which pieces of information go with which participants?\n  Which are functions and which are values?\n  Finally, how should the Relay account information and Bob's identity be represented?\n  (Hint: Reach has a type named <span class=\"snip\"><span style=\"color: #24292E\">Address</span></span> that represents an account address!)<a href=\"#p_26\" class=\"pid\">26</a>\n</p>\n<div class=\"note\">\n  <p><i

return the Relay identity and the Bob identity.\n  The idea here is that Alice will create the Relay account in the midst of the program and Bob will provide his own identity when he's acting as

Bob.\n  We don't know of any beautiful way to derive this program from first principles, and instead must appeal to your JavaScript programming skills.\n  If you'd like a hint, remember that you can call <span class=\"snip\"><span style=\"color: #24292E\">stdlib.newTestAccount</span></span> any number of times and that a backend's participant functions don't need to be called at the same time.<a

class=\"pid\"></i>Lines 18 through 21 create a JavaScript <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">Promise</a> that will be filled in later by Alice.<a href=\"#p_46\" class=\"pid\">46</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_47\" class=\"pid\"></i>Alice's <span class=\"snip\"><span style=\"color: #24292E\">getRelay</span></span> function (lines 26 through 32) creates the new account and communicates it \"outside of the network\" through the aforementioned Promise.<a href=\"#p_47\" class=\"pid\">47</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_48\" class=\"pid\"></i>Bob's thread (lines 34 through 48) waits for the Promise to resolve and then connects to the application with this new account.<a href=\"#p_48\" class=\"pid\">48</a></li>\n  <li><i id=\"p_49\" class=\"pid\"></i>The Relay's <span class=\"snip\"><span style=\"color: #24292E\">getBob</span></span> function (lines 43 through 46) returns his own address to receive the funds.<a

completely automated test of this program.\n  If instead you wrote it so that it ran interactively and had Bob paste in the information about the new Relay account, it might be easier for you to code with those two aspects totally separated.<a href=\"#p_50\" class=\"pid\">50</a>\n</p>\n<p><i id=\"p_51\" class=\"pid\"></i>Let's see what it looks like when we run this program:<a href=\"#p_51\"
