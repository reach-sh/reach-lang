@title[#:version reach-vers #:tag "ref-model"]{Language Model}

This document describes the fundamental assumptions and concepts of Reach. First, we discuss the model of running a Reach program in @secref["ref-model-eval"]. Next, we discuss the details about compilation of a Reach program that are relevant to Reach programmers in @secref["ref-model-compile"]. Finally, we discuss how Reach programs are syntactically constructed in @secref["ref-model-syntax"].

@margin-note{This is not an introduction to Reach.
We recommend reading @seclink["overview"]{the overview} for an introduction to what Reach is and the @seclink["tut"]{tutorial} to get started with programming Reach.

Furthermore, it is not an introduction to @tech{consensus networks} or "blockchain".
If you would like to read such an introduction, we recommend the @link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)"]{Wikipedia article on consensus} and the @link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain"]{Wikipedia article on blockchains}.}

@section[#:tag "ref-model-eval"]{Evaluation Model}

Reach programs specify a decentralized application (@deftech{DApp}), which is a distributed computation involving many @tech{participants} and utilizing one @tech{contract} on one @tech{consensus network} for reaching agreement on the intermediate @tech{values} of the computation.
@margin-note{"Many" is a technical term that means "zero or more".}
When the computation terminates, all @tech{participants} agree on the outcome, because they agreed on the intermediate @tech{values}.

At the start of a Reach computation, the set of @tech{participants} is not necessarily known and can evolve throughout the execution of the application.

A @deftech{consensus network} is a network protocol with a @tech{network token}, a set of @tech{non-network tokens}, a set of @tech{accounts}, a set of @tech{contracts}, and a @tech{network time}.
A @deftech{network token} is an opaque unit of account.
A @deftech{non-network token} is an opaque unit of account;
typical @tech{consensus networks} allow the set of @tech{non-network tokens} to grow over time and be issued by @tech{accounts}.
A @tech{consensus network}'s @deftech{network time} is some monotonically increasing discrete value from a totally ordered set; typically, it is the height of the blockchain for consensus networks that use blockchains.
A @deftech{time delta} represents the difference between two points in @tech{network time} as a discrete number of @tech{network time} units.
Each @tech{network time} corresponds to some @deftech{network second}, which has a connection to real time; typically, it is a @link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time"]{Unix time}.
@tech{Consensus networks} support @deftech{transfers} of @tech{network tokens} and @tech{non-network tokens} between @tech{accounts}.
An @deftech{account} is a unique identity (called an @deftech{address}) with a non-negative balance of @tech{network tokens}.
@tech{Accounts} may sign @tech{values} in a way that may not be repudiated or impersonated; this is called @deftech{publication}.
The chapter, @secref["ref-networks"], discusses which @tech{consensus networks} are supported by Reach.

@margin-note{This description of @tech{consensus networks} is an abstraction that may not be directly implemented by actual networks.

For example, in UTXO-based networks, there is not typically an explicitly represented @tech{account} balance ledger.
However, such networks do @emph{abstractly} have @tech{accounts} with balances, because particular private keys represent @tech{accounts} which have exclusive access to some set of @tech{network tokens} which is their balance.

Similarly, Reach's notion of time may appear overly abstract ("monotonically increasing ... totally ordered set") if you know that many consensus networks are based on blockchains and use the chain length, also called the height or block number, as a notion of time.
In this case, @tech{network time} would be a natural number, which is a prototypical model of a totally ordered set.
However, Reach is flexible enough to support non-blockchain-based consensus networks, so it does not mandate this particular natural number-based notion of time.

Finally, Reach's definition of @tech{consensus network} does not require any particular technology or features of this.
In particular, it does not only refer to so-called "layer-1" protocols, nor does it exclude centralized systems with trusted parties controlling the network.

@margin-note{Reach assumes that @tech{network tokens} and @tech{non-network tokens} behave identically, but often they do not; @seclink["guide-nntoks"]{this article} discusses the causes and consequences of this.}

@deftech{Contracts} are @tech{accounts} with three extra capacities: they persistently store @tech{values} (called the @deftech{consensus state}), they may receive @tech{publications}, and when they receive @tech{publications}, they systematically process them and may modify their @tech{consensus state}, make @tech{publications}, and may @tech{transfer} @tech{network tokens} and @tech{non-network tokens} in response to the reception.
In addition to @tech{values}, @tech{consensus state} may contain a fixed number of @deftech{mappings} between an @tech{address} and a @tech{value}.
These @tech{mappings} are referred to as "@deftech{linear state}" because their size is linear in the number of @tech{participants} in the @tech{contract}.
Furthermore, a @tech{contract} may provide @deftech{views} of its @tech{consensus state}, which are labeled functions and values which may be hierarchically organized, such as @litchar{NFT.owner} or @litchar{scoreOfPlayer}.
These @tech{views} are visible in sub-trees of the computation graph.
A @tech{contract} may also emit @deftech{event}s, which are externally observable values that are persistently available.
The creation of a @tech{contract} is called @deftech{deploy}ment.

A @deftech{participant} is a logical actor which takes part in a @|DApp|.
It is associated with an @tech{account} on the @tech{consensus network}.
@margin-note{The same @tech{account} may be used by multiple @tech{participants} in a @|DApp|.}
A @tech{participant} has persistently stored @tech{values}, called its @deftech{local state}. It has a @tech{frontend} which it @tech{interacts} with. A @deftech{frontend} is an abstract actor which supports a set of functions which consume and produce @tech{values}; when a @tech{participant} invokes one of these functions it is referred to as @deftech{interact}ion.

A @deftech{participant class} is a category of @tech{participant} that may occur many times in a single application.
Members of a @tech{participant class} are referred to as @deftech{participant instances} when their status as a member of a class is important, but just "@tech{participants}" otherwise.
@tech{Participant instances} are independent @tech{participants} like any other; for example, with their own @tech{local state}, @tech{frontend}, and so on.
The main distinction is that when a member of a @tech{participant class} @tech{join}s an application, it is not @tech{fixed} like other @tech{participants}, because a @tech{participant instance} does not exclusively represent the @tech{participant class}.

An @deftech{API} is a source of @tech{publications} that do not correspond to any @tech{participant} and are therefore like asynchronous events that impinge on the computation.
The @tech{contract} returns a value to an @tech{API} call.
@tech{API}s are organized into a labeled hierarchy, like @litchar{Contest.vote} and @litchar{User.write}.

Since @DApps have an associated @tech{contract}, they have an associated @tech{account}. @margin-note{The @tech{contract} account must be distinct from all @tech{participant} @tech{accounts}.} This @tech{account} is assumed to be empty when the computation starts.@margin-note{On some @tech{consensus networks}, it is possible for @tech{transfers} to a @tech{contract} @tech{account} to occur outside of the purview of Reach. If this occurs, then those @tech{network tokens} are remitted to the @tech{originator} of the final @tech{consensus transfer}.} Any @tech{network token}s transferred into the @tech{account} must be removed by the @|DApp|'s completion. This is called the @deftech{token linearity property}.

A @|DApp| computation can be seen as a graph of @tech{steps} with a unique first @tech{step}. A @deftech{step} is a set of @tech{local steps} by @tech{participants} followed by a single @tech{consensus step} introduced via a single @tech{consensus transfer}.

A @deftech{local step} is executed by a single @tech{participant} and is a sequence of @tech{local computations}. A @deftech{local computation} may bind a piece of @tech{local state}, @tech{assert} a property of the @tech{local state}, or @tech{interact} with the @tech{frontend}. A @deftech{consensus transfer} is executed by a single @tech{participant} (called the @deftech{originator}) which makes a @tech{publication} of a set of @tech{public} @tech{values} from its @tech{local state} and @tech{transfers} zero or more @tech{network tokens} to the @tech{contract} @tech{account}. A @tech{consensus transfer} specifies an alternative @tech{step}, called a @deftech{timeout}, that is executed if the @tech{originator} fails to make the transfer before a given @tech{time delta} has elapsed. All @tech{local state} is initially @deftech{private}, until it is explicitly made @deftech{public} via a @deftech{declassification}, which is a kind of @tech{local computation}.

A @tech{participant} is said to @deftech{join} an application when it first makes a @tech{publication}.
For non-@tech{participant instances}, this also makes the @tech{participant} @deftech{fixed}, whereby the @tech{consensus state} includes an assignment from the @tech{participant} to the particular @tech{account} (i.e. @tech{address}) which it is @tech{fixed} to.
All subsequent @tech{publications} by a @tech{fixed} @tech{participant} must be from the @tech{fixed} @tech{account}.

A @deftech{consensus step} is a graph of @tech{consensus computations} with a unique first computation.
A @deftech{consensus computation} either binds @tech{consensus state},
@tech{asserts} a property of the @tech{consensus state},
performs a @tech{transfer},
selects between different next @tech{consensus computations},
communicates with another @tech{contract} (referred to as a @tech{remote object}),
or @deftech{commits} to the next @tech{step}.

An @deftech{assert}ion is either: a @deftech{knowledge assertion}, which is a claim that one @tech{honest} @tech{participant} cannot know something that another @tech{honest} @tech{participant} does know; a @deftech{static assertion}, which is an always-true formula; an @deftech{assumption}, which is a true formula if @tech{frontends} behave @tech{honest}ly; a @deftech{requirement}, which is a true formula if @tech{participants} behave @tech{honest}ly; or, a @deftech{possibility assertion}, which is a formula for which there exists some values that @tech{honest} @tech{participants} and @tech{frontends} could submit which results in the truth of the formula.
An @deftech{honest} @tech{participant} is one that executes the @tech{steps} specified by the @|DApp|, while an @tech{honest} @tech{frontend} is one that only returns @tech{values} which ensure that all @tech{assumptions} evaluate to the boolean @reachin{true}.

A @deftech{value} is either: the @litchar{null} value, a boolean, an unsigned integer, a string of bytes, a @tech{digest}, an @tech{address}, a fixed tuple of @tech{values}, a statically-sized homogeneous array of @tech{values}, or a fixed record of @tech{values}.
@tech{Values} may be @deftech{digest}ed to produce a @link["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"]{cryptographic hash} of their binary encoding.

@tech{Values} are in one of three possible conditions.
They could be @tech{consensus state}, in which case they are known to all @tech{participants}.
They could be @tech{local state} of a single @tech{participant}, which means they are known by only that @tech{participant}.
@tech{Local state} is further divided into @tech{private} @tech{local state}, which cannot be included in a @tech{publication}, and @tech{public} @tech{local state}, which can.
These conditions are summarized thus:
@itemlist[
 @item{@bold{Local, private}: The initial state.}
 @item{@bold{Local, public}: The result of @reachin{declassify}.}
 @item{@bold{Consensus}: The result of @reachin{publish}.}
]

@section[#:tag "ref-model-compile"]{Compilation Model}

Reach programs cannot execute independently of a @tech{consensus network} and a set of @tech{frontends}.
Thus, the semantics of Reach treats these components abstractly and does not specify their semantics.
Therefore, the semantics of Reach cannot be effectively implemented directly in a virtual machine or interpreter.
Instead, Reach programs are @deftech{compile}d to
a particular @tech{consensus network} @deftech{connector}
and a set of @tech{participant} @deftech{backends}
which execute the computation of the particular @tech{consensus network}.
@tech{Connectors} and @tech{backends} are sound
if they faithfully model the abstract semantics assumed by Reach.

During compilation, the Reach compiler automatically verifies that the @tech{token linearity property} and all @tech{static assertions} and @tech{possibility assertions} are true whether @tech{participants} and @tech{frontends} are @tech{honest} or not.
Similarly, all @tech{knowledge assertions} are verified using a conservative approximation of @tech{participant} knowledge.
This conservative approximation assumes that all inputs to a computation are revealed by the result of the computation, except for @tech{digests} and @tech{interact}ion.
This approximation means that Reach cannot, for example, reason about the details of manually expressed encryption formulas and will assume they are insecure.
Finally, a subtle point about the knowledge checker is relevant: technically participants with different identities in a Reach program may actually be instantiated by the same principals, i.e. if Alice choses to play a game of a Chess against herself, where she controls both Black and White; as this is always possible, the knowledge checker does not consider it a violation of a claim that White knows something Black does not.

If these @tech{assert}ions cannot be statically verified, then the compilation process aborts.
After this verification, such @tech{static assertions} and @tech{possibility assertions} are removed from the program and do not occur at runtime.
In contrast, @tech{assumptions} are enforced at runtime by @tech{backends} and @tech{requirements} are enforced at runtime by @tech{connectors}.
If @tech{assumptions} are violated at runtime, then the @tech{backend} aborts.
If @tech{requirements} are violated at runtime, then the @tech{connector} ensures that all aspects of the @|DApp| (the @tech{contract} and @tech{participant}) ignore the inducing @tech{consensus transfer}, which often results in a @tech{timeout}.

@section[#:tag "ref-model-syntax"]{Syntax Model}

Reach programs are specified via a subset of well-formed JavaScript syntax inside @tech{source files}. The section @secref["ref-programs"] describes the syntax of Reach programs in detail.
