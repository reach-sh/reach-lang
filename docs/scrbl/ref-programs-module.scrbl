@title[#:version reach-vers #:tag "ref-programs-module"]{Modules}

A Reach @deftech{source file} is a textual file which specifies a Reach @tech{module}.
It is traditionally given the file extension @litchar{rsh},
e.g. @filepath{dao.rsh}.

A @deftech{module} starts with @reachin{'reach @|reach-short-vers|';}
followed by a sequence of @tech{imports} and @tech{identifier definitions}.
@margin-note{See @seclink["guide-versions"]{the guide section on versions} to understand how Reach uses version numbers like this.}

@section[#:tag "ref-programs-module-stmts"]{Statements}

Any statements valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-stmts"]{computation} are valid for a module.
However, some additional statements are allowed.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-export"]{@tt{export}}

Module-level @tech{identifier definitions} may be @deftech{export}ed
by writing @(mint-define! '("export")) @reachin{export} in front of them.
For example,
@reach{
  export const x = 1;
  export const [a, b, ...more] = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
  export function add1(x) { return x + 1; };
}
are valid @tech{exports}.

Module-level identifiers may also be @tech{export}ed after the fact,
and may be renamed during export. For example:

@reach{
 const w = 2;
 const z = 0;
 export {w, z as zero};
}

Identifiers from other modules may be re-exported (and renamed),
even if they are not imported in the current module.
For example:

@reach{
 export {u, x as other_x} from './other-module.rsh';
}

An @tech{export}ed identifier in a given @tech{module} may be @tech{import}ed by other @tech{modules}.

Exports are also exposed to the frontend via @jsin{getExports}. Functions are only exposed
if they are typed, that is, if they are constructed with @reachin{is}.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-import"]{@tt{import}}

@(mint-define! '("import"))
Reach supports two types of module @deftech{imports}: @tech{local imports},
which refer to modules that exist within your project, and
@tech{package imports}, which refer to remote libraries that may be fetched
from external sources such as @link["https://github.com"]{GitHub}.
@margin-note{
Read @seclink["guide-packages"]{the guide section on packages} for more details.
}

@tech{Package imports} are easily distinguished from @tech{local imports} by a
mandatory @litchar|{@}| character at the beginning of the path string.

@subsubsection[#:tag "ref-programs-import-local"]{Local imports}
@reach{import 'games-of-chance.rsh';}

When a @tech{module}, @litchar{X}, contains a @deftech{local import},
written @reachin{import "LIB.rsh";},
then the path @filepath{LIB.rsh} must resolve to another Reach @tech{source file}.
The @tech{exports} from the @tech{module} defined by @filepath{LIB.rsh} are included in the set of @tech{bound identifier}s in @litchar{X}.

@(mint-define! '("from"))
@reach{import {flipCoin, rollDice as d6} from 'games-of-chance.rsh';}

Import statements may limit or rename the imported @tech{identifiers}.

@reach{import * as gamesOfChance from 'games-of-chance.rsh';}

Imports may instead bind the entire @tech{module} to a single @tech{identifier},
which is an @tech{object} with @tech{fields} corresponding to that @tech{module}'s @tech{exports}.

@tech{Import} cycles are @tech{invalid}.

The path given to an @tech{import} may @bold{not} include @litchar{..} to specify files outside the current directory @bold{nor} may it be an absolute path.

It @bold{must} be a relative path, which is resolved relative to the parent directory of the @tech{source file} in which they appear.

@subsubsection[#:tag "ref-programs-import-package"]{Package imports}
@reach{
import * as func from
  '@"@"reach-sh/reach-example-package';
import * as func from
  '@"@"reach-sh/reach-example-package:src/func.rsh';
import * as func from
  '@"@"github.com:reach-sh/reach-example-package#main:src/func.rsh';
}

@deftech{Package imports} obey the same rules as @tech{local imports} but
support an extended path syntax which allows Reach programmers to seamlessly
plug into third-party libraries hosted on the internet.

All package imports begin with the @litchar|{@}| character.

Package import paths are comprised of the following components:
@itemlist[
@item{
@bold{(Optional): The @tt{git} server where the package is hosted.}

This component must be followed by a @litchar{:} character.

This component defaults to @link["https://github.com"]{GitHub} (i.e. @tt{github.com}) if no site is specified.

Examples: @tt{github.com:}, @tt{bitbucket.org:}.
}

@item{
@bold{The account registered with the host site.}

This component must be followed by a @litchar{/} character.

Examples: @tt{reach-sh/}, @tt{jeapostrophe/}.
}

@item{
@bold{A repository associated with the account.}

Examples: @tt{reach-example-package}, @tt{nfts}.
}

@item{
@bold{(Optional): A @tt{git ref} or @tt{git commit} used to represent the
package version.}

If no @tt{ref} is specified, Reach first tries to find the requested module
on the repository's @tt{master} branch, and if that fails then on the @tt{main}
branch once more.
@margin-note{
@tt{git refs} are discussed in further detail
@link["https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefrefaref"]{here}.
}

@bold{It is highly advisable that package authors use @tt{git tags} to denote
version "releases", e.g. @tt{v0.2.1}, and that consuming code target the
desired @tt{git tag} rather than a branch name.}
@margin-note{
Read
@link["https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging"]{this guide}
to learn more about how @tt{git tags} work.
}

This component must be preceded by a @litchar{#} character.

Example: @tt{#v3.0.6}.
}

@item{
@bold{(Optional): The directory in which the module may be found.}

This component must be preceded by a @litchar{:} character and must end with
a @litchar{/}.

Example: @tt{:src/lib/}.
}

@item{
@bold{(Optional): The filename of the requested module.}

Defaults to @tt{index.rsh}.

If the module exists within a subdirectory it must be preceded by a @litchar{/}
character.

Example: @tt{@"@"reach-sh/example#v1.01:parent/child/pkg.rsh}.

However, if the module is stored in the root of the repository, it must instead
be preceded by a @litchar{:} character.

Example: @tt{@"@"reach-sh/example#v1.02:pkg.rsh}.
}
]

The following forms are all syntactically valid @tech{package import}
expressions:

@(pkg-fmts)

@(hrule)

Since @tt{git} repositories evolve and change over time, Reach takes extra
steps in order to pin a given module import's version to the specific @tt{SHA} hash of the specified revision at the time the package is first installed.
These pins are stored in a @tech{lockfile}, which should be included in your source control system.

@section[#:tag "ref-programs-module-exprs"]{Expressions}

Any expressions valid for a @seclink["ref-programs-compute-exprs"]{computation} are valid for a module.
However, some additional expressions are allowed.

@subsection[#:tag "ref-programs-reach.app"]{@tt{Reach.App}}

@(mint-define! '("Reach") '("App"))
@reach{
export const main = Reach.App(() => {
 const A = Participant("A", {
  displayResult: Fun(Int, Null),
 });
 deploy();

 const result = 0;
 A.only(() => { interact.displayResult(result); });

 exit();
});
}

@deftech{Reach.App} accepts a no-argument function that specifies a @|DApp|.
This function is applied during compilation as an @tech{application initialization}.
It specifies the entire @|DApp| in its body.

If the result of @reachin{Reach.App} is eventually bound to an identifier that is @tech{export}ed, then that identifier may be a target given to the compiler, as discussed in @seclink["ref-usage-compile"]{the section on usage}.

@subsubsection{Deprecated long-form}

@reach{
export const main =
  Reach.App({}, [Participant("A", {displayResult: Fun(Int, Null)})], (A) => {
    const result = 0;
    A.only(() => { interact.displayResult(result); })
    exit();
  });
}

Previous versions of Reach only allowed a form of @tech{Reach.App} which accepted three arguments:
an @reachin{options} object,
an @reachin{applicationArgs} tuple,
and a @reachin{program} arrow of the form @reachin{(applicationIds) => body}.

This form was equivalent to
@reach{
Reach.App(() => {
 setOptions(options);
 [ applicationIds ] = applicationArgs;
 deploy();
 body
});
}

The current version of Reach will automatically transform these "ternary" @reachin{Reach.App} instances into the above form.

Future versions of Reach will deprecate this transform and such programs will be @tech{invalid}.
