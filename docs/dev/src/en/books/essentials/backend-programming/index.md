This chapter focuses on Reach Programming which uses the Reach programming language to write code in *index.rsh*, and the [Reach Script]() to (among other actions) compile *index.rsh* into *index.main.mjs*:

* [Modules](/en/books/essentials/backend-programming/modules/) explains the statements and expressions specific to Reach `.rsh` files.

* [Modes](/en/books/essentials/backend-programming/modes/) details the four modes of Reach: *Initialization*, *Step*, *Local Step*, and *Consensus Step*.

* [JavaScript](/en/books/essentials/backend-programming/javascript/) describes the idiosyncrasies of compiled Reach code.

* [Error Codes](/en/books/essentials/backend-programming/error-codes/) lists the error codes produced by the Reach Compiler.
