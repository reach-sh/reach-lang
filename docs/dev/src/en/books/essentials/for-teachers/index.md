# For Teachers

This chapter is a placeholder for the Reach Curriculum. I will hide this section before we go live, and I will re-show this section when the first version is ready.

The **goal** of the Reach Curriculum is to help teachers, instructors, trainers, and coaches **train** learners to **use** Reach Documentation. The Reach Curriculum is primarily a learning framework rather than a content repository, and Reach curriculum developers and trainers should (1) utilize Reach Documentation whenever possible during instruction, and (2) actively provide feedback to improve and refine Reach Documentation so that it better serves their learners.

A [Curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum) is a planned sequence of instruction that includes [these 5 major components](https://www.shareyouressays.com/knowledge/5-major-components-of-a-curriculum/100348). The Reach Curriculum must be the work product of a cross-departmental team that understands the learner, aims and objectives, subject matter, modes of instruction, and evaluation.
