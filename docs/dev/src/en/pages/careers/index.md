# Careers

Reach makes blockchain development practical. Even though PCs and handheld devices existed before Microsoft and Apple, these computers didn't become mainstream until these companies provided a practical way for developers to create applications that breathed life into hardware. Reach is the go-to programming language and development platform for creating, launching, maintaining, and monetizing applications that breathe life into blockchain, whether public or permissioned.
