# {#ref-backends-rpc-client} Client Walkthrough

The [Reach RPC Protocol](##ref-backends-rpc-proto) is designed to be simple to implement in languages that support HTTP and JSON interaction.
This document walks through the implementation of an RPC client in [Python](https://www.python.org).
An example use of this library is shown in the [tutorial section on RPC-based frontends](##tut-7-rpc).
The entire library is 80 lines of code.

The library uses a few standard Python libraries for interacting with JSON,
HTTP servers, and networking:

```
load: /rpc-client/py/src/reach_rpc/__init__.py
range: 1-9
```

```
load: /rpc-client/py/src/reach_rpc/__init__.py
range: 11-27
```

The library provides a single function, `{!py} mk_rpc`, that accepts the @{seclink("ref-backends-rpc-opts")}.

```
load: /rpc-client/py/src/reach_rpc/__init__.py
range: 28-34
```

It starts by observing the `verify` option and informing the Python library it uses for HTTPS interaction to turn off warnings.
It displays a warning to users that they should be nervous about using this setting.

```
load: /rpc-client/py/src/reach_rpc/__init__.py
range: 35-47
```

Next, it attempts to connect to the Reach RPC Server and throws an error if it does not respond quickly enough.

```
load: /rpc-client/py/src/reach_rpc/__init__.py
range: 52-62
```

It defines a function, `{!py} rpc`, which will be returned later on, that
implements the protocol for synchronous value RPC methods.
It formats a given request, posts it, and then returns the deserialized result.
It prints debugging information for convenience.

```
load: /rpc-client/py/src/reach_rpc/__init__.py
range: 63-79
```

It defines a function, `{!py} rpc_callbacks`, which will be returned later on, that
implements the protocol for interactive RPC methods.
On lines 64 and 65, this function inspects its third argument, `{!py} cbacks`,
and separates the `{!py} callable` arguments from the values and creates the
intermediate objects, `{!py} vals` and `{!py} meths`, to provide the RPC
invocation.
After it makes the call, in the `{!py} while` loop starting on line 68, it
inspects the result to determine if it is a final answer or an
interactive RPC callback.
If it is a callback, as indicated by the test on line 72, then it extracts the
name of the method, `{!py} p['m']`, and invokes it in the original third
argument, `{!py} cbacks`, with the provided arguments.
It replaces the `{!py} p` value with the result of that continuation invocation and continues.

```
load: /rpc-client/py/src/reach_rpc/__init__.py
range: 80-80
```

Finally, it returns `{!py} rpc` and `{!py} rpc_callbacks` to the user.
