# {#quickstart} Quickstart

This quickstart guide outlines the step-by-step instructions for getting started with programming in Reach.
You can install on the following operating systems:

* [Windows](##qs-win)
* [Linux](##qs-linux)
* [MacOS](##qs-mac)

If you have any issues running `reach`, please check the [Troubleshooting](##trouble) page for solutions.

# {#qs-win} Windows

Reach requires [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) to be installed.

## {#qs-win-prereqs} Prerequisites

* Windows 10 installed with version 2004 or higher,

or

* Windows 11

* Virtualization Technology (VT-x) enabled on the BIOS

## {#qs-win-install} Installation

Click the Windows icon, type `Powershell`, and then click `Run as Administrator`.
There are a number of commands that need to be run to get Windows ready for Reach.

To install WSL on Windows, enable these two features:

Enable WSL:
```cmd
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

Enable the Virtual Machine feature:
```cmd
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

After enabling these two features, reboot:
```cmd
shutdown -r -t 0
```

After rebooting, reopen `Powershell` as an administrator, and execute the following commands:

```cmd
cd c:\; mkdir downloads; cd c:\downloads; wget  -uri https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi -outfile .\wsl_update_x64.msi; .\wsl_update_x64.msi
```

In the Command Prompt window, run the following command to set the WSL version to 2:

``` cmd
$ wsl --set-default-version 2
```

After setting up the default version, install the WSL distribution:

``` cmd
$ wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

:::note
When the installation is finished, a terminal called `Ubuntu` should open on your screen.
It will request that you set up a user and password.
Make sure you don't skip this step.
:::

## {#qs-installing-docker} Installing Docker:

To install Docker we will use `winget`.
It is the official package manager for Windows.
We will download the package from Microsoft's official GitHub account.

To install Winget run:
``` cmd
cd c:\downloads;
wget -uri https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases/download/v1.3.431/Microsoft.DesktopAppInstaller_8wekyb3d8bbwe.msixbundle -outfile .\winget.msixbundle; .\winget.msixbundle
```
A window should pop up.
Click Update.

Next, install Docker using winget:

``` cmd
winget install docker.dockerdesktop
```

After installing Docker, reboot:
``` cmd
shutdown -r -t 0
```

## {#qs-win-conf-docker} Configuring Docker:

Open Docker and wait for it to initialize.
Click the `Settings` (gear) icon along the top of the Docker app.

Verify that `WSL 2.0` and `Use Docker Compose V2` are checked.

![WSL 2 settings in Docker`](/quickstart/wsl-2.png)
![Docker Compose in Docker`](/quickstart/docker-compose.png)

Click `Resources` in the left-hand menu, and make sure that `Enable integration with additional distros` is checked, and that `Ubuntu` is selected.

Click the Ubuntu icon in the Windows Start-up menu to open the Ubuntu terminal.
You will need to provide a `username` and `password` for Ubuntu.

In the terminal, run the following to install `make` and `curl`:

```cmd
$ sudo apt install make curl
```

Create and navigate to the `reach` directory with the following command:

``` cmd
$ mkdir -p ~/reach && cd ~/reach
```

Download Reach with the following command:

``` cmd
$ curl https://docs.reach.sh/reach -o reach ; chmod +x reach
```

Reach is successfully downloaded if the following command returns a version number:

```
$ ./reach version
```

You are now ready to start programming in Reach.
Check out our [tutorials](##tuts) to get started.

# {#qs-linux} Linux

Reach requires [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)), [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## {#qs-linux-prereqs} Prerequisites

* A version of Linux compatible with Docker.

Our instructions are written assuming you're using the most recent version of Ubuntu.
Check the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) page for supported distros.

## {#qs-linux-install} Installation for Ubuntu

Follow the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) instructions for installing on your version of Linux.
Check the commands required for completing the tasks below for your distro.
The following instructions from
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) assume that Ubuntu is the installed distro.

In the terminal, run the following to install `make`:

```cmd
$ sudo apt install make curl
```

Next, run the following to allow `apt` to use repositories containing HTTPS:

```cmd
$ sudo apt install ca-certificates gnupg lsb-release
```

Docker will be installed by adding a package repository from Docker; this requires updating your `apt` configuration:

```cmd
$ sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Then run:

```cmd
$ sudo echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \ $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

And then run:

```cmd
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

You may want to run the [post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) that Docker recommends.

Create and navigate to the `reach` directory with the following command:

``` cmd
$ mkdir -p ~/reach && cd ~/reach
```

Download Reach with the following command:

``` cmd
$ curl https://docs.reach.sh/reach -o reach ; chmod +x reach
```

Reach is successfully downloaded if the following command returns a version number:

``` cmd
$ ./reach version
```

You are now ready to start programming in Reach.
Check out our [tutorials](##tuts) to get started.

# {#qs-mac} MacOS

Reach is compatible with M1 chips and Intel chips running macOS 10.15 or newer.
Installation instructions should not differ regardless of the MacOS architecture.
Reach requires installing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## {#qs-mac-install} Installation

`make` should be preinstalled.
Test this by opening `terminal` and running the following command:

``` cmd
$ make --version
```

Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and follow the prompts to complete application setup.

According to the [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), "Docker Desktop for Mac includes Compose along with other Docker apps, so Mac users do not need to install Compose separately."

To verify that Docker Compose is operating on your Mac, execute the command:

``` cmd
$ docker-compose --version
```

When it returns a version number, Reach is ready to be installed.

Create and navigate to the `reach` directory with the following command:

``` cmd
$ mkdir -p ~/reach && cd ~/reach
```

Download Reach with the following command:

``` cmd
$ curl https://docs.reach.sh/reach -o reach ; chmod +x reach
```

Reach is successfully downloaded if the following command returns a version number:

```
$ ./reach version
```

You are now ready to start programming in Reach.
